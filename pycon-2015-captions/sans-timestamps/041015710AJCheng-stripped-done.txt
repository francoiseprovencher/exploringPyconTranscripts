THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TO THE...
[ MICROPHONE FEEDBACK ]
>> WELCOME TO THE LAST OF OUR THREE SESSIONS ON
THINGS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN THE WORLD.
I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE JENNY CHENG TO TALK ABOUT
3D PRINTING WITH THE BLENDER API.
[ Applause ]
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD CONFERENCE SO FAR.
IT'S GOING TO BECOME A GREAT CONFERENCE IN JUST A
MOMENT BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE HERE AT 3D PRINT
ANYTHING WITH THE BLENDER API.
MY NAME IS JENNY CHENG A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IN
NEW YORK AND I DO A LOT OF 3D PRINTING AS A HOBBY
SO FOR THE NEXT 30 MINUTES, I'M GOING TO SHARE
THAT HOBBY WITH YOU SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GO OUT
AND START MAKING YOUR OWN CREATIONS.
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT 3D PRINTING BEFORE.
IT IS AN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.
WHAT THIS MEANS, IT BUILDS AN OBJECT UP LAYER BY
LAYER BY LAYER.
YOU CAN CONTRAST THIS WITH OTHER MANUFACTURING
PROCESSES, LIKE C & C MACHINING, WHERE YOU TAKE A
BLOCK OF MATERIAL AND CUT AWAY AT IT TO LEAVE
YOUR FINAL OBJECT.
THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF 3D PRINTERS
OUT THERE.
THEY USE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES, LIKE LASERS,
EXTRUDERS WHICH ARE SQUEEZING MATERIAL THROUGH A
LITTLE NOZZLE AND BINDERS WHICH SORT OF USE A
GLUE-LIKE MATERIAL TO BIND PARTICLES TOGETHER.
YOU CAN 3D PRINT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS,
LIKE PLASTIC, METAL AND EVEN CERAMIC.
THERE'S LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES, VERY GOOD FOR
RAPIDLY PROTOTYPING OBJECTS OR MAKING VERY CUSTOM
OBJECTS.
3D PRINTING IS NOT A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S ONE
THAT'S BECOME READILY AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS.
WITH THE RISE OF DESKTOP 3D PRINTERS AND ONLINE
SERVICES WHERE YOU SEND THEM A MODEL AND THEY'LL
MAIL YOU THE MODEL BACK 3D-PRINTED, ALL YOU
REALLY NEED IS 3D MODEL TO GET STARTED WITH 3D
PRINTING.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT 3D MODELS.
THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIONS OF 3D
MODELS.
ONE COMMON REPRESENTATION IS TO REPRESENT YOUR 3D
MODEL AS A SET OF VERTICES, EDGES AND FACES.
SO THIS 3D CUBE WE HAVE HERE HAS A SET OF
VERTICES, THEY ARE THE CORNERS OF THE CUBES.
EACH VERTEX IS A POINT IN SPACE, IT, IT HAS AN X
COORDINATE AND A Y COORDINATE.
THE VERTICES WILL BE THE EDGES OF THE CUBE.
AND FACES ARE WHAT'S BOUND BY THE SET OF EDGES.
THEY REPRESENT THE SURFACE, SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE
FRONT FACING SQUARE IS A NAYS.
WITH MODELING AUTHOR 3D PRINTING, THE FACES ARE
OFTEN TRIANGULATED OR CUT UP INTO TRIANGLES
INSTEAD OF BEING SQUARE.
SO THE VERTICES YOU NEED THE 3D FILE TO REPRESENT
THE MODEL.
SDL FORMAT IS A POPULAR FORMAT TO CONTAIN THE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE VERTICES AND FACES.
HERE WE HAVE AN ASCII VERSION OF THE FILE, IT'S
JUST TEXT, ESSENTIALLY A TEXT FILE WITH NUMBERS
INDICATING COORDINATES FOR THE VERTICES.
THERE IS A BINARY VERSION OF XTL WHICH IS
COMPRESSED THE ASCII STL.
SO HERE WE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRST BLOCK, THIS
BLOCK REPRESENTS THE FACE THAT'S HIGHLIGHTnd
BLUE, THE TRIANGULAR FACE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
CUBE, AND EACH ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTED VERTEX MAPS
TO ONE OF THE VERTEX -- VERTICES ON THAT BOTTOM
OF THE CUBE.
YOU MIGHT NOTICE THERE IS A NORMAL UP HERE, MIGHT
BE A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BUT ASIDE FROM VERTICES
EDGES AND FACES, EVERY FACE HAS A NORMAL.
WHAT THIS MEANS IS EVERY FACE HAS A SIDE-EDNESS
TO IT, AN INSIDE AND AN OUTSIDE, AND THE
DIRECTION OF THE NORMAL IS WHAT THE OUTSIDE OF
THE FACE IS.
SO HERE WE HAVE THE NORMAL BEING ZERO, ZERO,
NEGATIVE ONE, WHICH IS ZERO IN THE EXTRACTION,
ZERO IN THE Y DIRECTION AND NEGATIVE ONE IN THE Z
DIRECTION, SO THIS NORMAL VECTOR POINTS
DOWNWARDS, AND THIS IS ASSIGNED TO A SPACE ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE CUBE WHICH MAKES SENSE SINCE THE
NORMAL CORRELATES TO THE OUTSIDEDNESS OF THE
FACE, YOU WANT YOUR OUTSIDE OF THE BOTTOM FACE OF
YOUR CUBE TO BE DOWNWARDS.
SO IF YOU KNOW ALL THE COORDINATES OF YOUR
IMAGINARY 3D MODEL, YOU CAN JUST USE YOUR
FAVORITE SOFTWARE OR FAVORITE PROGRAM LANGUAGE TO
OUTPUT A TEXT FILE WITH A SERIES OF COORDINATES
LIKE THIS AND SEND THAT OFF TO BE 3D PRINTED.
THIS -- WHERE IT GET TEDIOUS IS, LET'S SAY YOU
HAVE YOUR MODEL BUT NOW YOU SUDDENLY WANTED TO
SCALE IT UP, MAYBE YOU WANT TO SCALE ONLY A
PORTION OF IT OR ROTATE A LITTLE PIECE AND NOW
YOU START WRITING A LOT OF MATHEMATICAL
FUNCTIONS.
LUCKILY FOR YOU, A LOT OF 3D GRAPHIC SOFTWARE
ALREADY PROVIDES THESE FUNCTIONALITY FOR YOU SO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE IT FROM SCRATCH.
THERE'S A LOT OF 3D GRAPHIC SOFTWARE OUT THERE.
IF YOU COME FROM AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND, YOU
MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH SOLID WORKS OR AUTOCAD.
IF YOU COME FROM GRAPHICS, YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR
WITH MAYA OR 3D STUDIO MAX OR EVEN RINA.
BLENDER IS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE 3D GRAPHIC
SOFTWARE AND IT'S ONE THAT I REALLY, REALLY LIKE.
IT'S OPEN SOURCE, UNDER GPL AND HAS A VERY LARGE
AND FRIENDLY COMMUNITY.
HAS A LOT OF MAILING LISTS, RSC CHANNELS.
FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND PEOPLE WILL BE
HAPPY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS.
IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF FEATURES, ASIDE FROM
MODELING AND GRAPHICS.
IT HAS VIDEO EDITOR, AS WELL AS A GAME ENGINE,
AND BECAUSE IT'S OPEN SOURCE, A LOT OF PEOPLE
CONTRIBUTE BACK TO IT SO THERE IS A MYRIAD OF
DIFFERENT ADD-ONS.
BLENDER RUNS ON LINUX, MAX AND WINDOWS, AND IT
HAS A PYTHON API, WHICH IS WHAT I FIND REALLY
COOL ABOUT BLENDER.
THE PYTHON API IS CALLED BPI.
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT BLENDER.
SO THIS IS BLENDER.
WHEN YOU FIRST START UP PROVIDES A DEFAULT CUBE
FOR YOU TO WORK WITH.
WHEN YOU FIRST START UP, YOU CAN REMOVE THAT IF
YOU WISH.
GOING TO HIT A BUTTON THAT SAYS "SCRIPTING."
THIS SCRIPTING BUTTON IS JUST FOR SETTING UP MY
WINDOWS, SO IT WILL ASK ME TO SCRIPT EASIER.
YOU CAN REARRANGE THE WINDOWS HOWEVER YOU LIKE,
BUT THIS IS JUST NEAT SHORTCUT TO GET SET UP
FASTER.
SO I'M GOING TO CLOSE ONE OF THESE WINDOWS AND
WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT ONE LATER.
INSTEAD, YOU SEE IN THE MIDDLE, THERE IS A 3D
VIEW, THE SAME 3D VIEW WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED,
AND ON THE BOTTOM, THERE IS A PYTHON TRACKTIVE
CONSOLE.
SO THIS IS LIKE A RIPPLE, YOU CAN START PRINTING
COMMANDS LIKE PRINT HELLO PYCON AND IT WILL
EVALUATE AND PRINT THAT.
SO LET'S START MAKING STUFF.
BLENDER HAS -- PROVIDES A LOT OF STOCK OBJECTS,
LIKE CUBES, CYLINDER, CONES AND MONKEY NAMED
SUZANNE.
SO YOU CAN START CREATING OBJECTS BY HITTING
CREATE, A CUBE BUTTON AND OUT WILL POP A CUBE.
NOW I'M GOING TO HOVER OVER THE CUBE BUTTON THAT
I JUST PRESSED AND A TOOL TIP WILL POP UP WITH
THE PYTHON API EQUIVALENT, SO I CAN JUST ENTER
THAT COMMAND INTO THE INTERACTIVE CONSOLE AND IT
WILL DO THE EXACT SAME THING.
BLENDER ALSO PROVIDES ANOTHER NEAT FUNCTIONALITY
IN THAT ALL THE ACTIONS YOU DO WILL BE LOGGED AS
THEIR API EQUIVALENTS AND IT WILL ALSO LOG THEIR
PARAMETERS SO YOU CAN REPLICATE WHAT YOU JUST DID
VERY EASILY.
SO HERE I'M GOING TO TYPE IN THE COMMAND TO
DELETE THE CUBE WHEN I PRESS THE SHORTCUT TO
DELETE EARLIER, IT LOCKED THAT, AND THEN I'M
GOING TO CREATE A CUBE THAT'S SLIGHTLY LARGER
WITH THE RADIUS OF FIVE AND THAT WAS THE RADIUS
WAS DISPLAYED IN THE LOG BEFORE.
THE WINDOW I CLOSED BEFORE WAS A TEXT EDITOR.
BLENDER SHIPS WITH A RATHER SIMPLE TEXT EDITOR
THAT CAN LOAD AND RUN SCRIPTS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THIS, YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN
TEXT EDITOR OF CHOICE AND THEN JUST LOAD YOUR
PYTHON SCRIPTS IN HERE.
SO I DO IMPORT BPI WHICH WILL IMPORT THE MODULE
AND I CALL THE SAME FUNCTION AS BEFORE TO CREATE
THE CUBE.
SINCE I'M IN A TEXT EDITOR, NOW I CAN DO COOLER,
MORE ADVANCED STUFF, LIKE LET'S SAY I WANT TO
MAKE A ROW OF CUBES, SO I AM GOING TO CREATE A
ROW OF CUBES AND I'M GOING TO MOVE THEM SLIGHTLY
BY SETTING THEIR X LOCATION.
SO I'M GOING TO RUN SCRIPT AND IT WILL CREATE FOR
ME A ROW OF CUBES.
YOU CAN SAVE THE SCRIPT AND BLENDER WILL ACTUALLY
SAVE A COPY OF THE SCRIPT WITHIN THE STOP BLEND
FILE AND IF EVER THE SCRIPT IS OUT OF SYNC WITH A
SCRIPT THAT, LET'S SAY, YOU FLOATED, BLENDER WILL
WARN YOU THAT THEY'RE OUT OF SYNC AND PROMPT YOU
TO RESYNC THEM.
SO WHILE CUBES ARE FUN, LET'S MAKE SOMETHING MORE
INTERESTING.
LET'S MAKE GLASSES.
SO HERE I'VE -- I WANTED TO TAKE AN IMAGE OF THE
FRONT OF A PAIR OF CLASSES FRAMES AND TURN IT
INTO A 3D PRINTABLE MODEL.
I WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE IT
EASIER TO PROTOTYPE A LOT OF DIFFERENT STYLE OF
GLASSES FRAMES FASTER.
SO I WROTE THIS SCRIPT THAT TAKES AN SVG OR IMAGE
VECTOR FILE OF A PAIR OF GLASSES, GOING TO HIT
"RUN," AND IT WILL ACT ON THAT IMAGE AND TURN IT
INTO A PAIR OF GLASSES FRAMES THAT I CAN PRINT.
HAS COOL LITTLE FEATURES, LIKE HAS NOSE PADS AND
IT HAS THE BRIDGE IN THE FRONT.
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT PROTRUDED.
SO SINCE I WANTED TO PROTOTYPE GLASSES THIS WAY,
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GLASSES I'VE
GENERATED ARE ACTUALLY GOOD ENOUGH AND -- OR,
RATHER, THEY'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO ACTUAL GLASSES SO
THAT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY OFF FROM WHAT YOU'RE
INTENDING ON TO DESIGN VERSUS WHERE YOU'RE END
PRODUCT IS.
SO HERE I TOOK THE FRONT IMAGE OF A PAIR OF
GLASSES I ALREADY OWNED.
I RAN THAT IMAGE THROUGH MY SCRIPT TO GET A
3D-PRINTABLE FRAME, I RAN THAT OUT AND POPPED THE
LENSES OUT OF MY ORIGINAL PAIR OF GLASSES AND
POPPED IT INTO THIS PAIR THAT I 3D PRINTED, AND
IF THE LENS FITS, I WILL KNOW I -- THAT I GOT A
CLOSE ENOUGH PROXIMATE GENERATED FROM SINGLE
FRONT IMAGE, SO HERE'S ME POPPING THE LENSES
INTO... THE PAIR OF GLASSES.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW YOU DO THIS USING THE
API.
THESE ARE LIKE THE VERY BEGINNING STEPS TO HOW TO
GET STARTED MAKING YOUR OWN GLASSES.
SO FIRST I IMPORT AND SVG VECTOR IMAGE, A 2D
IMAGE, I'M GOING TO SCALE IT UP SO IT'S BIGGER
AND THEN EXTRUDE IT SO IT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF
THICKNESS TO IT.
SO HERE IS MY BLENDER APPLICATION, GOING TO
IMPORT PAIR OF GLASSES.
IT'S VERY SMALL WHEN YOU FIRST IMPORT IT BUT IF
YOU ZOOM IN, YOU CAN SEE IT.
NOW, I'M GOING TO HOVER OVER WHAT I WOULD HAVE
CLICKED IF I WAS DOING THIS VIA THE U.I., BUT
INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO CALL IT API -- CALL ITS API
EQUIVALENT TO SCALE IT UP.
I'M DOING TO SCALE IT UP APPROXIMATELY TEN TIME
ITS ORIGINAL SIZE, JUST TO WORK WITH IT A LITTLE
BIT EASIER.
NEXT I'M GOING TO EXTRUDE IT AND EXTRUDE WHICH
JUST MEANS IT WILL GIVE IT SOME THICKNESS SO
INSTEAD OF A 2D FLAT IMAGE, IT'S GOING TO BECOME
A 3D FIGURE.
SO I HOVER OVER WHERE I WOULD HAVE TYPED IN A
VALUE TO EXTRUDE IT AND, INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO
CALL THE EXTRUDE FROM THE CONSOLE.
SO NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THICKNESS.
IT'S PROBABLY RATHER HARD TO SEE ON HERE SO I'M
GOING TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF THIS CURRENTLY BLACK
PAIR OF FRAMES TO SOMETHING MORE VISIBLE.
SO I'M GOING TO CHANGE IT TO A BRIGHT PURPLE
COLOR JUST SO YOU CAN SEE IT EASIER AND WORK WITH
IT EASIER.
SO THERE'S YOUR GLASSES.
INSTEAD OF TYPING ALL THOSE IN THE CONSOLE, I
COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY HAVE WRITTEN ALL THOSE
IN A SINGLE PYTHON SCRIPT AND THEN HIT "RUN," AND
IN A SINGLE CLICK, IT'S GOING TO DO THE EXACT
SAME THING BY TURNING THE PICTURE INTO A PAIR OF
GLASSES.
THERE IS A LOT MORE STEPS I DID IN MY OWN SCRIPT
BUT THIS IS THE VERY BEGINNING STEPS ON HOW TO
MAKE YOUR OWN GLASSES.
LET'S BACK UP AND TALK ABOUT THE HIGH LEVEL
THINGS THAT I DID.
YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED I TYPED IN BPI DATA A LOT
AND THIS IS BLENDER'S WAY FOR YOU TO INTERACT
WITH THE DATA OBJECTS THAT BLENDER PROVIDES, SO
IF I WANT TO SAY CHANGE VERTEX, THEN THE DOTS
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT REPRESENT
POINTS IN 3D SPACE, I CAN GO IN TO DATA, I CAN
CHECK IT THERE, I CAN GRAB THE COORDINATES AND
MOVE THEM AROUND.
YOU MIGHT HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT I TYPED BPI.OPS
A LOT.
BPI.OPS REPRESENT BLENDER'S OPERATORS.
ESSENTIALLY, EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE IN BLENDER IS
AN OPERATOR CALL AND OPERATORS ARE MODE
DEPENDENT.
SO BLENDER IS VERY MODAL, HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT
MODES.
ONE YOU PROBABLY ENCOUNTER THE MOST ARE THE
OBJECT MODE AND EDIT MODE AND OBJECT MODE DEALS
WITH THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO THE OBJECT AS A WHOLE
AND EDIT MODE TEND TO DEAL WITH FINER DETAILS OR
SUBCOMPONENTS OF THE MODEL, SO WHEN YOU INVOKE AN
OPERATOR CALL, THE CALL ITSELF WILL DO INTERNAL
POLL TO CHECK THE STATE OF THE APPLICATION TO SEE
WHAT MODE THEY'RE IN.
AND IF IT'S NOT IN EXPECTED MODE, IT WILL FAIL
AND THROW AN EXCEPTION.
OTHERWISE IT WILL EXECUTE ITS COMMANDS.
SO SOME MODE -- SOME OPERATORS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE
IN OBJECT MODE AND ON THES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN
EDIT MODE, SO EXAMPLE OF OPERATOR, WE USED WAS
SCALE.
SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REPRESENTATION.
WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO GET STARTED
MODELING IN BLENDER WITH THE API.
WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT BPI.DATA AND
BPI.OPS MEANT.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MODEL WITH
3D PRINTING CONSTRAINTS IN MIND.
SO YOU CAN'T PRINT EVERY 3D OBJECT YOU CAN THINK
OF.
THERE IS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS YOU
NEED TO KEEP IN MIND.
ONE IS YOUR OBJECT HAS TO BE MANIFOLD AND THIS
HAS A VERY MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION BUT YOU CAN
THINK OF IT AS YOUR OBJECT NEEDS TO BE WATERTIGHT
OR HAS NO HOLES IN ITS SURFACE, OR ROUGHLY THAT
EVERY EDGE NEEDS TO HAVE TWO FACES.
IF IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THIS CONSTRAINT, A LOT OF
SUBSEQUENT PROCESSES DOWNSTREAM WON'T KNOW HOW TO
HANDLE THE MODEL THAT YOU HAVE.
SO THAT'S ONE CONSTRAINT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN
MIND.
SECOND ONE IS YOUR NORMALS NEEDS TO FACE
OUTWARDS.
REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT NORMALS ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE CUBE?
SO BASICALLY, WHAT THIS MEANS IS, YOUR OUTSIDE --
THE OUTSIDEDNESS OF YOUR FACES NEED TO BE ON THE
OUTSIDE OF YOUR MODEL.
IF, LIKE, LET'S SAY ONE OF THEM'S FLIPPED, THAT'S
NO GOOD.
AND LASTLY, ANOTHER CONSTRAINT TO THINK ABOUT IS
YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY VERTICES, SO WHEN WE ARE
LOOKING AT THE CUBE BEFORE, WE SORT OF
REPRESENTED TWO CORNERS OF CUBE AS TWO VERTICES
WITH AN EDGE IN-BETWEEN.
WE COULD HAVE EASILY JUST AS WELL REPRESENTED
THAT EDGE AS HAVING, LET'S SAY, 10,000 VERTICES
IN-BETWEEN, CONNECTED BY VERY, VERY RARE TINY
EDGES AND THAT'S A TOTALLY LEGITIMATE
REPRESENTATION BUT BECAUSE OF SUDDENLY THERE'S A
LOT MORE VERTICES, GOING TO SLOW DOWN ANY POST
YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THAT AWAY BECAUSE YOU
ASKED FOR A 15 GIGABIT MOVIE FILE SO YOU CAN SEND
A VERY SHORT MESSAGE THAT SAYS I DON'T NEEDS THIS
ANYMORE AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY USEFUL WITH
SERVER PUSH.
SERVER PUSH IS KIND OF THE BIGGEST HEADLINE
FEATURE, NOT ACTUALLY THAT WIDELY USED AND
PROBABLY WON'T BE, BUT THE SERVER CAN SEND YOU
RESPONSES TO REQUESTS IT THINKS YOU WILL MAKE AND
THIS IS NOT SOME FORM OF PSYCHIC WIZARDRY, THINGS
TO DO WITH THE SERVER KNOWS THE HTML PAGE CALLS
IN THE FIVE SERVER DOCUMENTS, SO YOU'RE GOING TO
ASK FOR THEM.
IT WILL SEND ITS RESPONSE IN ADVANCE.
THIS IS ONLY FOR PRIME CATCHES, THE ONLY
           PROCESSING THAT HAPPENS.
AND ALSO THE -- SOME OF THE POST-PROCESSING
YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THAT AWAY BECAUSE YOU
ASKED FOR A 15 GIGABIT MOVIE FILE SO YOU CAN SEND
A VERY SHORT MESSAGE THAT SAYS I DON'T NEEDS THIS
ANYMORE AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY USEFUL WITH
SERVER PUSH.
SERVER PUSH IS KIND OF THE BIGGEST HEADLINE

TO DO WITH THE SERVER KNOWS THE HTML PAGE CALLS
IN THE FIVE SERVER DOCUMENTS, SO YOU'RE GOING TO
ASK FOR THEM.
IT WILL SEND ITS RESPONSE IN ADVANCE.
THIS IS ONLY FOR PRIME CATCHES, THE ONLY SOFTWARE
WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE LIKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
VE
YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THAT AWAY BECAUSE YOU
ASKED FOR A 15 GIGABIT MOVIE FILE SO YOU CAN SEND
A VERY SHORT MESSAGE THAT SAYS I DON'T NEEDS THIS
ANYMORE AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY USEFUL WITH
SERVER PUSH.
SERVER PUSH IS KIND OF THE BIGGEST HEADLINE
FEATURE, NOT ACTUALLY THAT WIDELY USED AND
PROBABLY WON'T BE, BUT THE SERVER CAN SEND YOU
RESPONSES TO REQUESTS IT THINKS YOU WILL MAKE AND
THIS IS NOT SOME FORM OF PSYCHIC WIZARDRY, THINGS
TO DO WITH THE SERVER KNOWS THE HTML PAGE CALLS
IN THE FIVE SERVER DOCUMENTS, SO YOU'RE GOING TO
ASK FOR THEM.
IT WILL SEND ITS RESPONSE IN ADVANCE.
THIS IS ONLY FOR PRIME CATCHES, THE ONLY ER AT
THE SEES AND THIS IS VERY -- THIS ASPECT IS --
THIS CONSTRAINT IS VERY PRINTER SPECIFIC AND MAY
BE MODEL SPECIFIC, DEPENDING ON HOW TO SEND THE
INFORMATION TO YOUR PRINTER.
A MORE VISUAL IS THE DOUGHNUT OR TAURUS THAT YOU
SEE ON YOUR RIGHT, THAT'S TOTALLY AVAILABLE TO BE
3D PRINTED, EVEN THOUGH YOU SEE THAT GAPING HOLE
IN THE MIDDLE.
IT'S NOT A HOLE IN THE SURFACE OF THE MODEL WHICH
IS KEY, WHEREAS THE ONE YOU SEE ON THE LEFT,
THERE'S THIS DARK RECTANGLE AREA AND THAT
REPRESENTS THERE'S MISSING FACES THERE, SO THE
EDGES ONLY HAVE ONE FACE ON ONE SIDE AND THERE'S
JUST NOTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THAT'S NOT A
GOOD MODEL.
SO BLENDER PROVIDES YOU WITH A LOT OF OPERATORS
TO HELP YOU FIX YOUR MODEL SHOULD YOU NEED HELP
FIXING.
YOU COULD USE FILL OR FILL HOLES TO FILL THE
MISSING COMPONENT, MISSING FACES.
YOU COULD USE -- MAKE OUTWARD NORMAL CONSISTENT,
SO YOU CAN USE THIS FUNCTION TO SORT OF PUT ALL
THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR FACES ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR
MODEL SORT OF DEFINE THE OUTSIDE AS THE OUTSIDE.
ALSO, YOU COULD USE A DECIMATION MODIFIER TO TRY
TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VERTICES WITHOUT USING
RESOLUTION.
WHEN YOU FIRST START 3D PRINTING, THERE'S A LOT
OF TOOLS OUT THERE THAT WILL SORT OF FIX YOUR
MODELS FOR YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
YOURSELF BUT THIS IS USEFUL, LIKE, BEING ABLE TO
FIX IT YOURSELF IS USEFUL WHEN THOSE TOOLS DON'T
WORK.
SO HAVE THIS LITTLE FIGURINE I MADE MAYBE TWO
YEARS AGO, AND AT THE TIME, I TRIED TO -- I
DIDN'T USE THIS -- DIDN'T MAKE THIS IN BLENDER
BUT I TRIED TO USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOFTWARE TO
HELP ME PRINT THIS LITTLE FIGURINE AND NONE OF
THEM WORKED.
ALMOST NONE OF THEM.
SO I TRIED USING NETFAB AT THE TIME, WHICH IS A
POPULAR MESH REPAIR TOOL THAT'S SPECIFICALLY
DEDICATED TO REPAIRING MODELS FOR 3D PRINTING AND
THAT FAILED.
I THINK ADOBE PHOTO SHOP WAS COMING OUT WITH 3D
PRINTING SUPPORT AT THE TIME AND THAT DIDN'T FIX
IT.
I TRIED USING MESH MIXER AT THE TIME, THAT DIDN'T
WORK, EITHER.
WHAT WORKED WAS AUTO DESK PRINT UTILITY WHICH IS
A SOFTWARE TO ALSO HELP YOU 3D PRINT BY AUTO
DESK, BUT IT TOOK THREE HOURS TO RUN ON MY
LAPTOP, TO SORT OF FIX THIS SMALL MODEL AND THERE
WAS A LOT OF LOSS IN RESOLUTION WHICH I DIDN'T
LIKE.
SO, MORE RECENTLY I DECIDED, HEY, LET ME TRY
WRITING MY OWN CLEAN-UP PROTOCOL SO I WENT INTO
BLENDER, SCRIPTED SOME INSTRUCTIONS TO HOW I
WOULD WANT MY MODEL TO BE FIXED AND IT RAN IN
ABOUT FIVE MINUTE AND PRODUCED A COMPLETELY
PRINTABLE MODEL.
SO THAT'S THE POWER OF BEING ABLE TO WRITE YOUR
OWN CLEAN-UP PROTOCOL.
SO WE'VE COVERED A LOT IN THE PAST 30 MINUTES.
WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS 3D PRINTING, HOW 3D
MODELS ARE REPRESENTED.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE BLENDER API, HOW TO SET UP --
HOW TO SET UP SCRIPTING, DIFFERENT WAYS OF
MODELING WITH THE OPERATORS AND 3D PRINTING
CONSTRAINTS.
I HOPE YOU'VE ALL LEARNED A LOT.
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT AUDIENCE.
AND THANK YOU.
[ Applause ]
MAYBE WE HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS?
QUESTIONS.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS BUT
WE'LL TRY TO DO QUESTIONS.
>> AUDIENCE:  JUST A QUICK QUESTION, CAN YOU
RECOMMEND ANY ONLINE RESOURCES FOR THOSE WANTING
TO GET INTO FINDING OUT ABOUT BLENDER AND PYTHON?
>> THE QUESTION WAS -- CAN YOU REPEAT THE
QUESTION?
>> AUDIENCE:  SORRY.
CAN YOU RECOMMEND ANY ONLINE RESOURCES FOR
GETTING STARTED WITH PYTHON AND BLENDER?
>> YES.
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUTube VIDEOS.
I DON'T KNOW ANY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE
IS A WEALTH OF YOUTube VIDEOS FOR BASICALLY
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO.
YOU CAN BE, LIKE, VERY SPECIFIC, LIKE I WANT TO
MAKE A HOUSE, HOW WOULD DO I THAT AND IT WILL TRY
TO LIKE -- PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN LIKE TONS AND TONS
OF TUTORIALS ABOUT THAT.
BUT, ALSO, FIND ME AFTERWARDS AND I'LL TRY TO
HELP YOU.
>> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU FOR THIS.
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY IN
BLENDER TO ROUND EDGES?
>> ROUND THE EDGES.
YES, SO IT'S SORT OF DEPENDS ON -- OKAY.
SO THE SIMPLE SOLUTION, YES, THERE IS A MODIFIER,
IT WILL, LIKE, TRY TO SMOOTH YOUR EDGES FOR YOU
BUT THE WAY IT DOES THAT IS IT SORT OF CREATES
MORE AND MORE EDGES FOR YOU SO TO, LIKE, ROUND IT
OUT AND IF YOU DO THAT, LIKE, LIKE A LOT OF
TIMES, YOU'RE GOING TO GET TONS OF VERTICES, BUT
THAT IS A VERY EASY WAY TO MAKE -- THERE IS A
SMOOTHING FUNCTION IN BLENDER TO TRY TO SMOOTH
OUT YOUR OBJECTS.
>> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU.
>> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I HAD A QUESTION ON THE SVG FILE.
CURRENTLY WORK FOR A SCHOOL AND WE HAVE A LOT OF
PROBLEMS TRYING TO ACTUALLY EITHER LASER SCAN
OBJECTS OR PHOTO GRAB THEM AND IMPORT THEM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BECAUSE WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS
MAKING, YOU KNOW, THE STL FILES MANUALLY IN
BLENDER OR MAKER BOT BUT HOW ARE YOU ACTUALLY
ACQUIRING CERTAIN IMAGES?
>> THE WAY I MAKE SVG FILES IS I USE INK SCAPE,
ANOTHER OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.
>> AUDIENCE: OKAY.
>> AND INK SCAPE, YOU CAN PASS IT IN LIKE ROSTER
IMAGE, LIKE A JPEG OR PINK, AND YOU CAN SAY
"TRACE OUTLINE" AND IT WILL DO ITS BEST TO TRACE
ITS OUTLINE AND TURN IT INTO A VECTOR IMAGE.
>> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU.
>> AUDIENCE:  HEY.
THANKS FOR THE TALK.
THERE WAS SUPER COOL.
I WAS WONDERING, I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE -- I
SUPPOSE ITS MAKES SENSE BUT DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE
THAT PEOPLE WERE USING BLENDER FOR 3D PRINTING.
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO, LIKE -- I
FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN STUFF ABOUT FILLING OBJECTS
IN DIFFERENT WAYS, LIKE THERE'S DIFFERENT
STRATEGIES FOR FILLING THE INTERNALS OF THESE
OBJECTS, LIKE DOES BLENDER HAVE SOMETHING THAT
DEALS WITH THAT OR...
OR IS IT JUST ASSUMED TO BE SOLID AND THAT'S THE
END OF IT?
>> SO, IT DEPEND -- SO IF YOU'RE PRINTING -- I'M
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FILLING --
>> AUDIENCE:  SO IF YOU HAVE A SQUARE, INSIDE
THE -- THOSE FACES, DO YOU GET TO SAY, THIS
SHOULD BE JUST FULL OF SOLID PLASTIC OR DO YOU
JUST SAY IT'S EMPTY?
>> IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'RE PRINTING IT SO IF YOU
HAVE LIKE A SQUARE, IT'S JUST THESE SETS OF
FACES.
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY PRINTING, IF YOU HAVE YOUR
OWN PRINTER, YOU CAN SPECIFY LIKE A FILL TYPE SO
YOU CAN SAY, LIKE, I WANT A HONEYCOMB PATTERN AND
YOUR PRINTER IS GOING TO TRY TO FILL IT IN A
HONEYCOMB PATTERN.
IF YOU'RE NOT PRINTING IT YOURSELF AND EXPORTING
IT TO SOMEONE ELSE TO PRINT, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO,
LIKE, SORT OF GENERATE WHAT THE INTERNALS WOULD
LOOK LIKE BEFORE YOU EXPORT THIS MODEL.
>> AUDIENCE:  SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BLENDER
THING, IT MIGHT BE A PREVENTER DRIVER DEAL, IS
THAT --
>> SPECIFYING THE FILL OF IT IS MORE ON THE
PRINTER SIDE OF THE JOB BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY
MODEL IT TO SAY, I WANT A SOLID FILL AND I WANT
IT TO BE FILLED THIS WAY BY ACTUALLY GENERATING
WHAT THE INTERNALS WOULD LOOK LIKE.
>> AUDIENCE:  OKAY.
EXCELLENT.
THANKS A LOT.
>> THANK YOU.
