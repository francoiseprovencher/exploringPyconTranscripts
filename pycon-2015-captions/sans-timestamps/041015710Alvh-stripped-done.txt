OUR SPEAKER TODAY IS LVH.
DISCRETE LOGS IN CHARACTERISTICS, AND HE'S
GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT BUILDING SECURE
SOFTWARE.
PLEASE WELCOME HIM.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> HI.
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.
SO I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING
SECURE SYSTEMS, BUILDING SECURE SOFTWARE IN
PARTICULAR.
SO I'M LVH.
THAT'S MY TWITTER HANDLE.
IF YOU WANT TO EMAIL ME, IT'S AN ANYTHING
UNDERSCORE. LVH.
IT'S JUST BUILDING SECURE SOFTWARE.
A QUICK INTRODUCTION.
SO HI, I'M LVH.
I'M A CRYPTOGRAPHER.
WE'RE AT PYCON, I'M SURE YOU'VE GATHERED.
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECIAL FRIENDS THAT I ONLY
GET TO SEE ONCE A YEAR, AND PYCON IS THAT.
PYCON IS A SPECIAL TIME OF THE YEAR FOR ME.
THIS YEAR I HAVE TWO TALK SLOTS AND A COUPLE OF
STAFF POSITIONS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL AID, WHICH
IS THE NON-TRIVIAL WORK OF DISTRIBUTING ABOUT A
QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS TO ABOUT 330
PEOPLE.
THAT'S NOT BRAGGING.
THAT'S AN APOLOGY IN ADVANCE.
I'M RUNNING ON A SIGNIFICANT SLEEP DEFICIT.
WITH ANY LUCK, I'LL BE SOMEWHAT COHERENT.
I HAVE A DAY JOB.
I WORK AT RACKSPACE.
IT'S A COOL PLACE TO WORK.
WE'RE A SPONSOR.
YOU SHOULD COME UP TO THE BOOTH AND TALK TO US.
IN THIS TALK, I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.  I HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS.  I'M GOING TO HAVE A META
CONVERSATION.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS WE
HAVE.
IN THIS TALK ARE COMMON SECURITY BUGS, WHAT
SOFTWARE TO USE OR STUFF LIKE THAT.
IT'S FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL, FAIRLY ABSTRACT.
SOFTWARE CONSISTENCY.
SO THE SOFTWARE IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.
THE HUMAN INTERACTIONS THAT END UP PRODUCING
ALL SOFTWARES HAVE BUGS.
SOME OF THOSE HAVE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS, AND
SECURITY BUGS ARE BAD.
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH PRETTY MUCH ALL
OF THESE STATEMENTS.
THAT SOUNDS VERY PESSIMISTIC, BUT THIS TALK IS
REALLY A MESSAGE OF HOPE.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE GIVE UP.
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE TRY TO ATTAIN
PERFECTION BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN, BUT I AM SUGGESTING THAT WE CAN DO
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS AN INDUSTRY.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TO DO
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS AN INDUSTRY.
SO UNFORTUNATELY, I'M GOING TO START WITH THE
BAD NEWS.
AND, QUITE FRANKLY, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY --
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WONDER THAT EVERYTHING IS
BROKEN ALL OF THE TIME BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SO
MANY REASONS.
MOST OF OUR TOOLS THAT WE USE FOR DEVELOPING
SOFTWARE DON'T GENERALLY WORK WHEN IT COMES TO
A LOT OF CORPORATIONS MESS IT UP.
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FAILS TO EDUCATE.  AND
SECURITY.
TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST.
IT'S VERY EASY TO FIND DIFFERENT SUBTLE WAYS
THAT STUFF IS BROKEN AND WHY IT'S BROKEN.
I MENTIONED THAT OUR TOOLS DON'T WORK.
SO SOMEWHAT FACETIOUSLY HOW DO I WRITE THE
UNION TEST FOR SECURITY.
RIGHT?
HOW DOES THAT WORK?
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY DO THAT.
SO ASK YOURSELVES HOW DO WE LEARN SOFTWARE.
THERE IS SOME NEW SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT I'M
INTERESTED IN, AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS.
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
USUALLY, WE READ DOCUMENTATION.
RIGHT?
HOPEFULLY.
AND THE PROBLEM WITH MOST SECURITY
DOCUMENTATION IS THAT IT'S LIKE MISSING OR
TERRIBLE.
MISSING IS ACTUALLY THE BETTER OPTION BECAUSE
MOST OF THE TERRIBLE DOCS JUST MISLEAD YOU, AND
NOT.
OH, SORRY.
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT, AND YOU'RE
THE OTHER PROBLEM IS GOOGLE AND SITE OVERFLOW.
I DON'T WANT TO RANT ON GOOGLE OR SITE
OVERFLOW.
THEY ARE WONDERFUL TOOLS, BUT THE PROBLEM IS
THEY HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF MISINFORMATION.
THE OTHER PROBLEM AND THIS IS GOING TO COME
BACK NUMEROUS TIMES IS THE GOOD PRACTICE LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE BAD PRACTICE.
AND TO MOST OF US, IT IS USUALLY
INDISTINGUISHABLE.
SO HOW ELSE DO WE LEARN ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S
NO DOCUMENTATION, RIGHT?
YOU PLAY WITH IT.
YOU INSTALL IT.
YOU LOOK AT THE CODE.
YOU OPEN UP A PYTHON REP.
YOU CREATE FROM OBJECTS, YOU PLAY WITH IT, YOU
HAVE A GOOD TIME, AND YOU REPEAT THE PROCESS.
AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU LEARN ENOUGH ABOUT THE
STUFF THAT YOU'RE USING.
AND YEAH, IT'S A GOOD TIME.
FORTUNATELY, SECURITY DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT
INFORMATION SECURITY WHEN YOU DO THE INSTALL
IT, PLAY WITH IT STEP,
WAY FOR VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING RELATED TO
THEN THE NEXT STEP IS GENERALLY GET IT WRONG,
AND THEN YOU REPEAT IT ANYWAY. AND THE PROBLEM
HERE -- I'M NOT SAYING LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
ALL DUMB, YOU'RE ALL GOING TO GET ALL THE
SECURITY STUFF WRONG.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE DOCS ARE TERRIBLE.
THIS IS REALLY TRICKY.
AND DOING IT RIGHT IS EXACTLY LIKE DOING IT
WRONG.
SO IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S CORRECT.
IT DOES ALMOST WORK THAT WAY.
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LEARN STUFF ABOUT
INFORMATION SECURITY IS TO TRY AND BREAK INTO
SYSTEMS.
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE AND COMPANIES THAT DO THIS
PROFESSIONALLY ALL OF THE TIME.
SO WHAT YOU COULD DO IS YOU CAN INSTALL SOME
SOFTWARE, TRY TO BREAK IT, YOU'LL PROBABLY
LEARN SOMETHING AND THEN YOU REPEAT.
AND USUALLY AFTER YOU BREAK SOMETHING HOPEFULLY
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE GENERALLY NOT
TRAINED TO THINK THAT WAY.
YOU FIX IT AS WELL.
RIGHT?
YOUR JOB AS SOFTWARE ENGINEERS IS TO MAKE
SOMETHING WORK, NOT TO MAKE SOMETHING FAIL.
ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT FAILURE IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER.
RIGHT?
THERE'S USUALLY ONLY ONE WAY THAT SOMETHING CAN
WORK CORRECTLY, AND THERE'S BASICALLY LOTS OF
WAYS THAT SOMETHING CAN FAIL.
THE ISSUES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SUBTLE.
RIGHT?
YOU'RE NOT TESTING THE HAPPY PATH THAT THIS
PARSES SOMETHING CORRECTLY.
YOU'RE TESTING, IF AN ATTACKER TRIES TO GET ME
TO PARSE SOMETHING INCORRECTLY, WHAT COULD
POSSIBLY GO WRONG.
THE ANSWER IS LOTS.
ALSO, WE'RE NOT PAID TO THINK THAT WAY.
OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO
REGULARLY WRITE SOFTWARE.
SO FOR THOSE ON VIDEO, THAT IS EVERYONE.
WHO REGULARLY GETS TO DO PIN TESTING?
SO THAT'S LIKE MAYBE FIVE PEOPLE?
THAT'S BEING VERY GENEROUS.
WHO REGULARLY GETS TO -- OKAY.
THERE'S VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS.
GENEROUS, A DOZEN.
THERE'S A LOT MORE THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THIS
ROOM.
SO WE DON'T GET TO DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS.
AND ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF
CORPORATIONS MESS IT UP.
SOMEWHAT UNDERSTANDABLE.
A LOT OF NEW FEATURES ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN
FIXING SECURITY BUGS.
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
THIS IS HUMAN NATURE.
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
AND WHEN YOU DON'T SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF EFFORT
INTO TRYING TO PREVENT IT, YOU'RE -- SOME
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES, AND THEY'RE
GOING TO HIT PRODUCTION.
AGAIN, GOOD PRACTICE LOOKS JUST LIKE BAD
PRACTICE, SO IT'S NOT LIKE THESE THINGS ARE
EASY TO SPOT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT A
TRAINED INFORMATION SECURITY PERSON WHO
BASICALLY HAS AVAILED LARGE PARTS OF THEIR LIFE
ANOTHER THING IS THAT A LARGE, PUBLICLY-TRADED
COMPANY -- WHICH WILL NOT BE NAMED.  I'M NOT
TO SPOTTING THESE THINGS.
TRYING TO PICK ON ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY.
THE REASON I PICKED THIS ONE IS BECAUSE THEY
HAD VERY PUBLIC, VERY MEDIATIZED, VERY VISIBLE,
SEVERAL SECURITY INCIDENTS.
AND SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS A PARTICULAR
INCIDENT, THE PSP KEY LEAK THAT INVOLVED
GETTING A VERY BASIC CRYPTO PRIMITIVE VERY
WRONG.
AND A LARGE, BUNCH OF INFORMATION GOT LEAKED.
THIS IS THE MARKET CAP OF SAID COMPANY.
THE BLACK LINE IS THE ZERO LINE.
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THESE ARE NOT COMPANY ENDING
EVENTS.
RIGHT?
SO YOU COULD ARGUE THAT FROM A PURELY MARKET
ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE THESE COMPANIES ARE BEING
ENTIRELY RATIONAL ACTORS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT
YOU CAN TOTALLY GET AWAY WITH IT.
ANOTHER PROBLEM IS ABSTINENCE ONLY EDUCATION.
SO WHAT DO WE TEACH?
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WOULD THINK THAT OR
CONSIDER YOURSELF TO HAVE HAD FORMAL CS
COUPLE CS CLASSES IF COLLEGE, RIGHT?
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF LISKOV
EDUCATION, SO LIKE AP CLASSES, OR YOU TOOK A
SUBSTITUTION.
A LOT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GLOBAL THING, BUT MOST
OF THE PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO -- THAT INCLUDES
MYSELF -- NOBODY LETS YOU WRITE THE WORD CLASS
INTO A TEXT EDITOR WITHOUT HAVING TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT LISKOV SUBSTITUTION IS.
THERE IS SOME FORMAL LOGIC THERE.
IT BASICALLY MEANS IF YOU HAVE A WIDGET, YOU
CAN REPLACE IT WITH A WIDGET OF THE ORIGINAL
SUBTYPE OF A WIDGET.
SO YOU CAN REPLACE THINGS WITH THEIR SUBCLASSES
OR SPECIALIZATIONS.
AND IT IS APPARENTLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE
THIS IS THE FIRST THING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT.
NOW, WHAT DON'T WE TEACH AND LEAST AUTHORITY?
THIS PRINCIPLE IS THAT YOU DON'T GIVE STUFF
MORE POWER THAN IT NEEDS.
A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE.
A LOT OF US WRITE PYTHON.
EVERY SINGLE PYTHON CODE THAT YOU CALL CAN
BASICALLY DO WHATEVER IT WANTS.
IT CAN READ STUFF.
CALLING SOME C LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME LIKE
IT CAN OPEN FILES.
CALLING SOME PYTHON WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT'S
DOING.
SO WE REALLY BESTOW A LOT OF AUTHORITY UPON
THINGS THAT AREN'T VERY WELL AUTHENTICATED.
NOW, THIS IS WHERE I DO THE EXTENSIVE HAND
WAVING BIT.
I DON'T MEAN TO HATE ON THE LISKOV PRINCIPLE.
IT IS A BASIC PIECE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE.
I'M NOT HITTING ON BARBARA LISKOV.
THAT IS NOT MY POINT.
WHAT I AM SAYING IS, AS AN INDUSTRY, WE WOULD
BE BETTER OFF IF WE STOPPED TALKING ABOUT --
WHENEVER WE SAID LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
AND INSTEAD TALKED ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE OF
AUTHORITY, I THINK WE WOULD BE IN BETTER SHAPE.
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT
IS INCREASINGLY SERVICING THE NEEDS OF A HUGE
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE, AND INCREASINGLY, THE
SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE ARE INCREASINGLY
GREAT.
YOU SHOULD GO TO GLIFKOWITZ TALK.
HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ETHICS OF ALL OF
THAT REALLY TIES INTO THE SAME THING.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SECURITY IS NOT A
THIS.
PRIORITY.
IT IS NOT IN BUSINESS.
IT IS NOT IN EDUCATION.
SO THEREFORE, DON'T BE A JERK TO YOUR PEERS
ABOUT INFO TECH WHEN THEY GET IT WRONG.
DON'T BE A JERK.
STRAIGHT UP, DON'T.
GENERIC LIFE ADVICE RIGHT THERE.
SO THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS.
I'VE WORKED FOR A LONG TIME ON SOMETHING CALLED
CRYPTO 101.
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT FOR FREE.
IT'S A BOOK CALLED CRYPTO 101.
THERE ARE WONDERFUL COMMUNITIES LIKE THE CRYPTO
COMMUNITY THAT SPEND A LOT OF TIME EDUCATING
PEOPLE.
MAYBE SOMEONE WITH FIX.EDU.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT ME.
SOME TOOLS THAT WE HAVE DO ACTUALLY WORK
FORTUNATELY MOSTLY BY ACCIDENT.
SO AGAIN, CHANNELING GLIF.
ACT OF PROMOTING LOCAL UNDERSTANDING.
APPLY THAT TO SYSTEMS, THAT MEANS THAT SMALL
HE SAYS THAT PROGRAMMING IS NOTHING IF NOT THE
COMPOSED PIECES ARE PREFERABLE TO LARGE
MONOLITHS.
AND THIS IS A BROKEN SLIDE.
SO THERE IS NO IMPLICATIONS HERE.
I DID NOT SAY THAT IF YOU USE MICRO SERVICES
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN SECURITY HAPPY LAND, AND
I DID NOT SAY IF YOU'RE OPERATING A MONOLITHIC
SERVICE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SECURITY
PROBLEMS.
CAN BE ALL SORTS OF STUFF CREWING FUNCTIONS,
CLASSES AND YES SERVICES TOO, BUT ARBITRARY
STUFF CAN MAKE STUFF WORSE.
ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE HAVE NOT JUST FOR SECURITY
BUT CAN HELP IS CURRENT  REVIEW.
IT'S THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR PROJECT
AFTER BUG TRACKER.
IT HELPS YOU CULTIVATE A CULTURE OF QUALITY.
IF YOU KNOW THAT YOUR STUFF IS GOING TO BE
SCRUTINIZED, THEN PROBABLY YOU'RE GOING TO
SPEND MORE TIME CLEANING IT UP.
FINALLY, THE ADVERSARIAL APPROACH THAT I TALKED
ABOUT, THE WAY THAT YOU FIX [INAUDIBLE] IS
THIS IS ALSO THE WAY YOU MAKE THESE RELIABLE.
YOU TRY AND GET THEM TO FAIL MERCILESSLY, AND
BREAK INTO THEM MERCILESSLY.
YOU DON'T STOP UNTIL YOU'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO
MAKE IT FAIL.
YOU CAN DO THAT IN-HOUSE.
YOU CAN DO THAT WITH THIRD PARTY AUDITS.
THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING MOST COMPANIES EXCEPT
MAYBE HEAD COUNT FROM HAVING PEOPLE WHOSE JOB
IT IS TO PROFESSIONALLY BREAK INTO THEIR OWN
PRODUCT.
HOW DO YOU WRITE CODE FOR SECURITY?
THERE IS A LOT OF AUTOMATED TESTING THAT YOU
CAN DO.
FOR EXAMPLE, MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE IS CERTIFICATE
TESTING.
SO BASICALLY UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO --
AND LET'S BE HONEST -- EVEN TO THIS DAY
BASICALLY TO WRITE SOFTWARE.  THE WORLD
ACTUALLY CHECKS YOUR CERTIFICATES CORRECTLY
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLY HARD.
IT IS VERY EASY OR AT LEAST IT'S TRACKABLE.
LET ME HEDGE THAT A LITTLE BIT.
TO WRITE A TEST WHERE IF YOU HAVE SOME SOFTWARE
THAT DOESN'T TOS, CREATE A FAKE SERVER WITH A
WILL REFUSE TO CONNECT TO THAT THING AND BE
VERY, VERY SURPRISED WHEN IT ACTUALLY, TOTALLY,
FAKE CERTIFICATE AND ASSERT THAT YOUR SOFTWARE
HAPPILY THINKS THAT THAT SPACE IS GOOGLE OR
RACKSPACE OR WHATEVER.
AND I MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT CORPORATIONS
MESSING IT UP.
NO, NOT ALL CORPORATIONS MESS IT UP.
SOME EMPLOYERS ARE GREAT.
THERE ARE LOTS OF GREAT PLACES WORKING FOR THE
PUBLIC GOOD THAT HAVE LARGE TEAMS WORKING
FULL-TIME, VERY CLEVER PEOPLE.
AT OROKU, GOOGLE.
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO MISS A COUPLE.
RACKSPACE IS ONE OF THEM.
WE HAVE PEOPLE EMPLOYED FULL-TIME TO DO THIS
KIND OF STUFF.
THIS DOESN'T FIX OUR SYSTEMIC INDUSTRY KIND OF
STUFF.
IT'S HELPING, BUT CLEARLY, WE'RE NOT DONE.
RIGHT?
I TALKED ABOUT SOME GOOD NEWS.
TALKED ABOUT SOME BAD NEWS.
NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS
THAT WE HAVE.
THAN I AM, ZUKO.
HE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER.
SO CHANNELING ANOTHER PERSON WHO IS WAY SMARTER
AND HE SAYS THAT SECURITY IS NOT ABOUT PERFECT
VERSUS IMPERFECT.
IT IS NOT ABOUT BETTER VERSUS WORSE.
IT IS ABOUT THIS ATTACK SURFACE VERSUS THAT
ATTACK SURFACE.
THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE TO EXPLAIN SOME
VOCABULARY, BECAUSE ATTACK SERVICE IF YOU ARE
SURFACE, IS ALL THE WAYS THAT CAN ATTACK YOU OR
POTENTIALLY GET ON THE INSIDE.
THE OTHER WORD IS THREAT MODEL.
HOW WILL IT ATTACK THE SYSTEM?
DESCRIBE HOW YOU THINK THAT -- WHAT ARE THEY
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO TO GET INSIDE THE WALL?
NOW, A LOT OF SECURITY PROPOSALS IN MY OPINION
ARE BASICALLY USELESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY
COMMUNICATE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO.
IN MY OPINION, THE GOOD SECURITY PROPOSAL
REQUIRES A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS, INCLUDING A
DESCRIPTION, A THREAT MODEL, A MOTIVATION FOR
THAT THREAT MODEL, WHO THIS AFFECTS, THE THREAT
SERVICE.
SO YOU NEED A VERY PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT
I'VE SEEN LIKE LOTS OF ISSUE TRACKERS HAVE
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WE'RE GOING TO USE
YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
SECURE COOKIES.
I CAN THINK OF LIKE AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT
CLASSES OF THINGS THAT THAT MEANS, AND EACH OF
THOSE HAVE TOTALLY BROKEN AND TOTALLY GOOD
IMPLEMENTATIONS -- OR AT LEAST ALL OF THEM HAVE
BROKEN IMPLEMENTATIONS.
IN PARTICULAR, IN SECURITY, THE DEVIL IS IN THE
DETAILS.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IF YOU DO THIS SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT, IT MEANS YOUR ENTIRE THING DIDN'T
ACTUALLY WORK.
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE A CONCRETE
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO
DO, OTHERWISE NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
THEN YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR THREAT MODEL.
WHAT ARE YOU PROTECTING AGAINST?
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE WALL AND SOMEBODY
TRYING TO GET IN, WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC ACTION
THAT IS NO LONGER GOING TO BE POSSIBLE AND HOW
IS THIS ADDRESSED NOW, AND IS IT NOT ADDRESSED
AT ALL.
REALLY WORK.
HOW WILL IT BE ADDRESSED AFTERWARDS?
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE, BUT IT DOESN'T
THEN YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN
ATTACK SURFACE.
THE THING IS A LOT OF STUFF IS NOT ACTUALLY A
STRICT IMPROVEMENT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
LET'S SAY THAT -- SO THE EXAMPLE HERE IS SOME
MONITORING SOFTWARE.
SO YOU HAVE SOFTWARE THAT MONITORS PROCESSES
AND SOMETHING ON A SERVER SOMEWHERE.
NOW, THAT THING REQUIRES A LOT OF PRIVILEGES
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT A LOT OF
OTHER STUFF.
WHEN YOU ADD THAT PIECE OF SOFTWARE, YOU HAVE
TO KEEP IN MIND WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S BUGS IN
THAT SOFTWARE.
RIGHT?
AND JUST BECAUSE I'M ADDING SOMETHING THAT
MIGHT BE PREVENTING SOME PROBLEMS DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M NOT ALSO ADDING SOMETHING THAT OPENS
OTHER DOORS AND ENABLES OTHER PROBLEMS.
AND FINALLY, THE USER EXPERIENCE WHICH IS
BASICALLY VERY OFTEN BEING FORGOTTEN ABOUT.
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
ASPECTS, RIGHT?
I AM LOOKING AT UGGP, SO.
BECAUSE YOU COULD SAY THINGS ALONG THE LINE OF
IT TURNS OUT -- WE LOOKED AT ALL THE ATTACKERS
OUR COMPANY HAS EVER GONE THROUGH.
IT TURNS OUT ALL OF THEM COME THROUGH A THING
CALLED THE INTERNET.
HOW ABOUT WE TURN OFF THE INTERNET, RIGHT?
THAT DOESN'T WORK.
PEOPLE NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS, AND OBVIOUSLY,
I'M BEING A LITTLE BIT FACETIOUS BUT NOT
REALLY.
A LOT OF US WORK AT COMPANIES WITH RESTRICTIVE
FIREWALLS.
VERY OFTEN THEY DON'T ACTUALLY FIX ANY SECURITY
PROBLEMS, BUT, MAN, DO THEY MAKE YOUR LIFE
HARD.
TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THREAT MODELS,
I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE
AND SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT BASICALLY
EVERYONE HERE WILL BE SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH.
SMART PHONES.
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, SMARTPHONES BASICALLY
CONTAIN EVERYTHING.
EMAIL, AND EMAIL HAS EVERYTHING.
CLEARLY, THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED.
YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOUR SMARTPHONE HAS YOUR
RIGHT?
THERE'S A LOT OF VERY, VERY SENSITIVE
INFORMATION ON ALMOST EVERYONE'S SMARTPHONE.
AND THE WAY WE PROTECT SMARTPHONES IS WITH LOCK
SCREENS.
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT NO LOCK
SCREEN IS OBVIOUSLY WORSE THAN ANY LOCK SCREEN,
ANY LOCK SCREEN NO MATTER HOW -- LIKE HOW
INEFFECTIVE IT IS, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE
BETTER THAN NO LOCK SCREEN AT ALL.
I HAVE AN IPHONE 6.
IT'S VIBRATING A LOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
AND I HAVE TWO OPTIONS, A PASS CODE AND A
FINGERPRINT.
ON SOME OTHER PHONES, YOU HAVE PATTERNS,
ANDROID, SAME THING WITH FACE RECOGNITION.
NOW, A PATTERN IS FUNDAMENTALLY A SECRET.
FACE RECOGNITION IS VIA METRICS.
IT'S LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE AS A
PHYSICAL PERSON, SO IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME
THING AS A FINGERPRINT AT LEAST FOR PURPOSES OF
SO WHICH ONE DO I PICK?
I HAVE TWO OPTIONS.
THIS DISCUSSION.
THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT THE SAME.
ONE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER.
RIGHT?
OKAY.
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE INSTINCTIVELY, A LOT OF
CONSUMERS -- WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE ARE
CONSUMER LEVEL DEVICES.
MOST PEOPLE WHO USE SMARTPHONES THESE DAYS ARE
ATECHNICAL.
SO BIOMETRICS LOOKS REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT'S
HOLLYWOOD LEVEL TECHNOLOGY.
RIGHT?
I MEAN, THE LAST GENERATION OF PHONES DIDN'T
HAVE BIOMETRICS.
IT ONE DOES, SO CLEARLY, THIS IS NEW, SHINY,
AND THEREFORE BETTER.
HOWEVER, BIOMETRICS HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS.
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT MOST OF THEM IN
DETAIL, BUT LIKE ONE OF THEM IS KEY ROTATION.
LIKE IF I DON'T LIKE THIS KEY ANYMORE. IF FOR
SOME REASON I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ATTACKER
SOMEWHERE THAT HAS MY FINGERPRINT, THEN HOW DO
LIKE I CAN'T CUT OFF MY THUMB AND EXPECT A NEW
ONE TO BE THERE TOMORROW WITH A NEW
I SWITCH OUT MY KEY.
FINGERPRINT.
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
I CAN'T REALLY HAVE SEPARATE CAPABILITIES.
I MEAN, IF I HAVE MY THUMB PRINT, THAT'S MY WAY
OF AUTHENTICATING FOR EVERYTHING.
I GUESS YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 10 OR 20 IF YOU
COUNT YOUR TOES.
IT GETS PUT ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU TOUCH FOR
FREE.
AND IT IS ACTUALLY TOTALLY POSSIBLE TO GET
FINGERPRINTS BACK OFF OF -- EVEN PICTURES,
APPARENTLY, BUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE LIKE
SLIGHTLY GREASY HANDS AND YOU HOLD A GLASS OF
WATER, GUESS WHERE YOUR FINGERPRINT JUST WENT.
IT IS A LITTLE TRICKY.
NOT EVERY RANDOM LOW BROW CRIMINAL CAN
REASONABLY BREAK INTO AN IPHONE WITH A
FINGERPRINT SCANNER.
BUT THAT SAID, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN THE REALM
OF THE IMPOSSIBLE, AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY,
MANY PEOPLE THAT COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS FOR,
LET'S SAY, A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS MAYBE.
TOO.
PEOPLE PICK POOR SECRETS BY AND LARGE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, SECRETS ARE PRETTY TERRIBLE,
AND EVEN IF YOU PICK A REALLY, REALLY GOOD
SECRET, KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'RE USING
SMARTPHONES FOR EVERYTHING, RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT I STARTED ALL OF THIS WITH.
AND IF YOU'RE OPENING -- IF YOU'RE UNLOCKING
YOUR PHONE, I DON'T KNOW, 20, 30, 40, 50 TIMES
A DAY, THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOMEONE
AROUND THAT FAIRLY REASONABLY COULD SEE WHAT
YOU JUST TYPED INTO THAT THING, AND AS LONG AS
IT'S A SECRET, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD YOUR
CODE IS.
THAT IS MOST OF THE TIME LIKE PEOPLE USE
SOMETHING LIKE 1, 2, 3, 4, OR THE BIRTHDAY OR
ANNIVERSARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
SO OKAY.
USUALLY IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
SO WE'VE REACHED THE FORK.
WHICH ONE DO I PICK.
RIGHT?
I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS.
THEY'RE BOTH NOT PERFECT.
LIKE NEITHER OF THEM -- BOTH OF THEM HAVE
SO HOW DO I KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT FOR ME.
ANY ANSWERS?
FLAWS.
I'VE GOT MODELS OBVIOUSLY OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T
HAVE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS.
AND IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THIS, I'M GOING TO
TALK ABOUT THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE AMERICAN FIFTH AMENDMENT.
I AM FULLY AWARE THAT WE'RE IN CANADA.
THE -- START WITH IT DISCLAIMER.
I'M NOT A LAWYER.
THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.
EVEN IF YOU GIVE ME MONEY, AND I'M NOT SUDDENLY
A LAWYER.
DON'T LISTEN TO ME.
THIS IS ALSO NOT ADVICE, I'M MERELY TRYING TO
ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THREAT MODELS.
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU THE FIFTH AMENDMENT
SAYS LOTS OF THINGS.
ONE OF THE THINGS IT SAYS IS THAT YOU CANNOT BE
COMPELLED IN ANY CRIMINAL CASE TO BE A WITNESS
FOR YOURSELF.
SORRY FOR THE GRATUITOUS GENERIC LANGUAGE.
I DID NOT WRITE IT.
BASICALLY YOU CANNOT BE FORCED TO DIVULGE
EVEN IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING.
EVEN IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GUILTY IN THE
SECRETS.
OBVIOUS CASE YOU CANNOT BE FORCED TO SAY THAT
YOU'RE GUILTY.
SO BASICALLY, YOU ARE PROTECTED FROM SELF
INCRIMINATION.
IT TURNS OUT, APPARENTLY, I WENT TO THE
PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY OF WIKIPEDIA FOR SOURCES
ON THIS.
THEY CAN'T FORCE SECRETS OUT OF YOU OF ANY
KIND.
PASS CODES ARE SECRETS.
PASSWORDS ARE SECRETS.
THIS IS APPARENTLY HELD UP IN COURT.
HOWEVER, FINGERPRINTS ARE CLEARLY NOT SECRETS.
POLICE CAN AND WILL TAKE YOUR FINGERPRINT.
THEY DO SO BY DEFAULT BASICALLY ALWAYS IF
YOU'RE ARRESTED I THINK IT IS.
SO BY THAT LOGIC, AND THIS ACTUALLY WENT TO
COURT, AND THE JUDGE RULED, NO, YEAH, YOU CAN
TOTALLY BE FORCED TO UNLOCK YOUR PHONE.
THAT IS HOW IT WORKS.
SO SOME PERSON WAS FORCED TO UNLOCK THEIR PHONE
AND SOME SECRETS WERE DIVULGED.
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON YOUR THREAT MODEL.
IF YOUR THREAT MODEL INCLUDES RANDOM PEOPLE,
SO WHICH ONE IS MORE SECURE?
THEN PROBABLY TOUCH ID BECAUSE THE ODDS THAT
YOU EVEN SUBCONSCIOUSLY PICK A REALLY BAD
PASSWORD WITH A PASS CODE IT'S LIKE FOUR
DIGITS.
SHOULDER SURFING IS A REAL THING.
TOUCH ID IS A USEFUL THING AND IT FIXED SOME
STUFF.
IF YOUR THREAT MODEL INCLUDES LAW ENFORCEMENT,
WHICH LET'S BE FAIR, THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF
PEOPLE, THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
ACTIVELY SUPPORT.
I FOR ONE THINK THE AFF IS GREAT.
THEN, YEAH, YOU WANT A PASS CODE BECAUSE PASS
CODES TOTALLY A SECRET.
SO AGAIN, THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START AN IPHONE.
I'M TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE THREAT MODELS AND THAT
IF YOU DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR
THREAT MODEL YOU CAN TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARGUABLY
IMPROVE YOUR SECURITY BUT DON'T EVEN NOT DO
ANYTHING BUT ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR REAL SECURITY
IN PLACES WHERE IT MATTERS MAKE IT WORSE.
ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE PROTECTING AGAINST,
HOW YOU'RE SECURING IT AND WHAT THE EFFECTS OF
SO THEREFORE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PAY
YOUR ACTIONS THAT YOU CALL SECURING IT ACTUALLY
ARE.
SO LET TO WRAP UP.
LIKE I SAID, THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A MESSAGE OF
HOPE.
RIGHT?
WE CAN DO THIS.
EVEN THOUGH THAT WE HAVE, LOOK, WE HAVE BREAKS
ALL THE TIME, SLACK GOT POPPED, SLACK ARE GREAT
GUYS.
EVERY COMPANY HAS THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS.
EVERY COMPANY IS UNDER ATTACK ALL THE TIME.
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL YOU ARE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG SEA.
A LOT OF FISH.
SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.
MOST OF OUR SECURITY PRACTICES ARE, QUITE
FRANKLY, BAD.
SO WITH THAT SAID, WE ARE WORKING ON IT.
WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT.
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING
ON THEM.
GREAT STUFF BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE, FOR
EXAMPLE, THE UB KEYS ARE FANTASTIC.
WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT COMPANIES PRODUCING
IT'S REASONABLE TO HAVE EVERY EMPLOYEE HAVE
SOME TWO FACTOR HARDWARE TOKENS ON THEIR
LANIARDS.
THAT'S FANTASTIC, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE REACH OF A LOT OF
COMPANIES, A LOT OF START-UPS NOT TOO LONG AGO.
AND AS A WHOLE, AS ENGINEERS, WE CAN
MEANINGFULLY IMPACT SECURITY.
LIKE WE WERE DOING IT ALREADY.
AND THE MORE OF YOU THAT JOIN US, THE BETTER.
AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO BE AN EXPERT.
LIKE, OBVIOUSLY, IT HELPS I GUESS.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE
DONE.
THERE'S LOT OF STUFF THAT REALLY DOESN'T
REQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE.
IT'S VERY EASY TO -- WELL, NOT VERY EASY BUT
IT'S POSSIBLE TO TRAIN PEOPLE ON THE JOB.
AND, YEAH, THERE'S LOT THAT YOU CAN DO.
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.
POSSIBLY SOME OF YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A YEAR FROM NOW YOU
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT INFORMATION SECURITY.
CAN'T BE VERY MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE
EVERY DAY OPERATIONAL SECURITY OF LITERALLY
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
AND THAT'S ALL I GOT.
THANKS.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> I THINK I HAVE JUST UNDER FIVE MINUTES.
IS THAT -- YEAH?
OKAY.
SO I WASN'T GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS, BUT SURE,
GO AHEAD.
YEAH?
>>  OH ON ONE OF YOUR SLIDES THERE WAS
SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING TEAM A TRY TO BREAK WHAT
TEAM B BUILT.
I TOOK THAT TO BE KIND OF A POLICY OF HOW TO
GET SECURITY AS A PRIORITY FOR YOUR COMPANY IN
KIND OF A WAY TO WEAVE IT INTO THE PROCESS.
WAS THAT YOUR INTENT?
AND EITHER WAY, DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW
TO ENCOURAGE YOUR COMPANY IN A SUCCESSFUL WAY
TO FOCUS ON SECURITY BETTER?
YES.
SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT, OBVIOUSLY,
>>  SO THAT WAS AT LEAST PARTIALLY MY INTENT,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WORK IN A LARGE CORPORATION,
THERE'S FOR MANY PEOPLE VERY LITTLE THEY CAN DO
WITHOUT A CLEAR MANDATE.
LIKE YOU CAN'T JUST DROP WHATEVER IT IS THAT
YOUR JOB IS RIGHT NOW AND SAY, OH, I'M GOING TO
GO FIX SECURITY FOR THE COMPANY.
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO GET FIRED.
BUT AS FOR HOW TO CONVINCE -- HOW TO CONVINCE
PEOPLE, LIKE IT DEPENDS, RIGHT?
IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON YOUR COMPANY.
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY COMPANIES LIKE PAYMENT
PROCESSORS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY
SERIOUSLY FROM DAY ONE.
THEN THERE'S COMPANIES WHERE IT'S LIKE THEY SAY
THEY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BUT AT THE END OF THE
DAY OTHER BUSINESS PRIORITIES TAKE OVER.
I THINK HONESTLY OUR BIGGEST ACE THERE IS GOING
TO BE ALL OF THESE PUBLIC BREAKS.
THEY ARE INCREASING IN BOTH SEVERITY AND
FREQUENCY.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, LIKE THEY ARE BECOMING MORE
VISIBLE AND THEREFORE LIKE THERE'S A --
MARGINALLY TECH COMPANIES UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO BREAK
BASICALLY EVERY CEO NOW EVEN FOR ONLY
INTO YOUR SYSTEM AND TO DO BAD THINGS WITH ALL
THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
THIS IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
THIS IS GETTING MORE AND MORE TO THE FOREFRONT.
AS TO WHETHER INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, IF YOU'RE
IN A BIG COMPANY, IT'S REAL HARD TO CONVINCE
ANYONE OF ANYTHING.
THE GOOD NEWS IS OTHER PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING
IT FOR YOU.
>>  THANK YOU.
>>  DONE-DONE?
YEAH.
OKAY.
SORRY.
I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS EITHER OUTSIDE
IN THE HALLWAY OR THERE WILL PROBABLY BE AN
OPEN SPACE THAT'S SECURITY RELATED AT SOME
POINT.
SO THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
