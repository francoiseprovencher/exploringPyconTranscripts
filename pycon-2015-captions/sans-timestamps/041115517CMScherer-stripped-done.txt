SO OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHAEL SCHERER, AND HIS
TALK IS TITLED ANSIBLE.
[APPLAUSE]
>> GOOD MORNING.
I'M A SPEAKER, I AM SPEAK ABOUT MYSELF.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL, I'M LIVING IN PARIS AND
CURRENTLY WORKING AT -- WHICH IS OPEN SOURCE.
SO BASICALLY I'M TRAVELING WHEN THERE'S A PROJECT
FOR A COMPANY -- FOR A PROGRAM THEY CALL ME.
WE NEED TO REGISTER FOR WHERE WE WANT TO DEPLOY FOR
TWO WEEKS AND WHEN WE SEE TWO WEEKS WE MEAN TWO
MORE, AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT MOSTLY WITH
ANSIBLE SO THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO SPEAK ABOUT IT.
JUST QUICKLY, DOES EVERYBODY KNOW WHICH IS -- WHICH
IS ANSIBLE AND EVERYTHING?
I HOPE SO.
OKAY.
SO IT WILL BE QUICK.
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS, BECAUSE YOU
KNOW THAT SOMEBODY -- SOME PEOPLE WILL JUST NOT
REACT.
SO ANSIBLE IS A TOOL WITHIN PYTHON -- IN PYTHON, TO
DEPLOY AND ORCHESTRATE ANY KIND OF TASK.
SO FOR US, WE NEED TO HAVE A LIST OF OUR SYSTEM.
OR THE SYSTEM YOU WANT TO MODIFY.
AND THEN YOU WILL PLAY YOUR PLAYBOOK, WHICH IS
SIMPLY, KIND OF A LIST OF COMMAND TO EXECUTE, SO
IT'S LIKE --
EACH COMMAND, IT'S USING MODEL.
FOR EXAMPLE, ONE MODEL TO INSERT, AND MAKE SURE YOU
INSERT TO STAT SERVICES, TO CREATE COMPLETE FILE
AND EVERYTHING.
SO YOU WANT SOMETHING SPECIAL, IT'S LIKELY ALREADY
DEVELOPED.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A TYPE OF COMMANDS THAT
YOU WILL RUN.
AND I WOULD USE THAT AS A CREATION TO SHOW YOU OR
WE CAN EXTEND EVERYTHING.
SO IT'S ALL ABOUT EXTENSION FOR ANSIBLE.
SO FIRST PART IS, I SAID, THE MOST COMMON USE IS
USING PLAYBOOK, BUT IN PRACTICE, YOU HAVE -- SO
FIRST ONE IS USING USAGE, WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE,
BECAUSE WHEN I USED TO BE WALKING IN OPPOSITION, I
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS, SO I DECIDED, OKAY, YOU DO NOT
WANT TO GIVE ME ACCESS, THEN I WILL TAKE IT, AND I
STARTED TO USE ANSIBLE LIKE THIS.
SO THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO WITHOUT ANY KIND OF
INFRASTRUCTURE.
OR BASH BECAUSE --
SO THAT'S THE PART MOST PEOPLE WILL ALREADY KNOW,
WHICH IS NOT THAT INTERESTING.
AND THERE IS A PART ABOUT USING EVERYTHING IN A
PYTHON SCRIPT, WHICH IS QUITE NICE.
BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO DO, WHICH IS TO USE
A SINGLE INTERNAL OBJECT, A RUNNER, AND GIVE
EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, I WILL BE ABLE TO WRITE EVERYTHING
ON THE SERVER.
AND THAT'S IT.
SO IF PEOPLE --
IT'S QUITE NICE YOU CAN USE PYTHON INSTEAD OF YAML,
BUT IT'S QUITE -- IT'S NOT -- YOU CANNOT DO MUCH.
THAT'S WHAT THE TOOL IS DOING.
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO EXTEND, SO IN THIS CASE, I
EXPLAINED THAT YOU HAVE A LIST OF SERVICES -- OF A
SERVER.
OH.
SO IT CAN BE A LIST OF -- IT'S A FILE.
LIKE THIS.
SO YOU CAN HAVE WWW.EXAMPLE.ORG.
WHICH IS QUITE SPECIAL BECAUSE YOU CAN SPECIFY WHAT
KIND OF PART YOU WANT.
FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW GARRET, IT'S -- SO WHICH
--
SO FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT YOU CAN DO IS MAKE INVENTORY.
THAT'S QUITE EASY.
DEVELOP A SCRIPT AND IT CAN BE ANYTHING.
OF COURSE IT WILL BE PYTHON, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE
ARE PYTHON.
BUT IT CAN BE BASH, IT CAN BE...
AND THE ONLY THING IT NEEDS TO DO IS...
AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO ADD META DATA.
A USER, OR PASSWORD.
FOR EXAMPLE, ALSO YOU CAN DO, BACK IN MY PREVIOUS
POSITION, I HAD TO CONNECT TO A NET TOP SERVER.
USING --
[NO AUDIO]
AND I HAD TO SCRIPT THAT GOES THERE.
ENTER PASSWORD.
CONNECT TO THE FIRST ONE, AND EVERYTHING.
AND USING ANSIBLE DATA INVENTORY, I WAS -- I WAS
ABLE TO WRITE EVERYTHING.
YOU CAN USE A SERVER IF YOU ARE USING PEPET, AND
LIKE ME YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS.
YOU CAN LIST THE SERVICE FROM WHERE -- FROM YOUR
CLOUD PROVIDER, EVEN IF IT'S NOT YOUR FAVORITE ONE.
I MEAN, WE DO NOT CARE.
AND JUST KIND OF SCRIPT IS READY, CONFIGURED BY
ENVIRONMENT.
LIKE YOU ARE USING IPI KEY IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND
YOU ARE DUMPING ALL YOUR VALUABLE.
CONSIDERING YOU DO NOT LIKE IT --
SO THERE IS THAT -- THAT'S ONE WAY WHERE YOU CAN
EXTEND AND MAKE SURE ANSIBLE IS WORKING WITH DATA
STRUCTURE.
AND YOU CAN DO MORE THAN ASAGE.
YOU CAN CONNECT, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH SHARED -- SO YOU
CAN PREPARE A SYSTEM WITH ANSIBLE.
IT'S ABLE TO DO THAT.
YOU CAN SEE TRENDS AND YOU HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT --
[NO AUDIO]
IT'S DONE BY THE SAME PEOPLE.
SO THEY WERE QUITE HELPFUL WHEN I HAD THE
CONNECTOR, SO YOU CAN USE ANSIBLE.
IN PRACTICE, I NEED TO FIX A BUG, THAT'S THE KIND
OF STUFF YOU WANT.
YOU CAN CONNECT WITH J, WITH ANYTHING.
[NO AUDIO]
YOU JUST NEED TO CREATE A MODEL.
I'M USING THE PASS FOR --
WITH --
[NO AUDIO]
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.
NEED TO IMPLEMENT CONNECTION CLASS.
WITH THE NAME OF THE MATTER.
AND THEN YOU BASICALLY --
THIS IS PYTHON, EVERYTHING IS CLOSED.
AND, TECHNICALLY, YOU CAN JUST CREATE A FILE USING
EXEC COMMAND.
AND THAT'S IT.
[NO AUDIO]
THAT'S FOR EXTENSION.
BUT WHERE YOU CAN GO BEYOND IS THROUGH YAML FILE.
AND SO I QUICKLY SPOKE ON PLAYBOOK, EXPECTING
EVERYBODY TO KNOW, BUT -- SO PLAYBOOK IS BASICALLY
SOMETHING YAML.
IT'S DOMAIN-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE BASED ON YAML.
WHICH IS QUITE NICE.
BECAUSE YOU CAN USE IT TO ANALYZE THE SCRIPT.
SO YOU CAN DO ALL KIND OF INTERESTING STUFF WITH
THAT.
EXCEPT THAT SINCE YOU CANNOT DO EVERYTHING IN YAML,
ADD A GINGER, WHICH IS WORD LANGUAGE FROM PYTHON,
AMONG 1,000 OTHERS.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,
THERE IS ONE SIMPLE PLAYBOOK THAT WILL INSTALL.
THERE'S A PACKAGE, IT'S A VARIABLE USED FOR A LINE.
AND SO I NEED TO CHANGE --
SO SINCE IT'S IN GINGER, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU
WANT.
LIKE ADDING A GINGER EXTENSION.
WHICH IS A SIMPLE PYTHON FUNCTION.
YOU CAN ADD A GINGER FUNCTION AND TAG.
AGAIN, REFER TO THE GINGER DOCUMENTATION ABOUT
THIS.
GINGER TWO EXTENSION.
IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT DOES, DO NOT TOUCH IT.
I DON'T KNOW, SO I DON'T TOUCH IT.
I DON'T SPEAK ABOUT IT.
CREATING SPECIFIC TAGS SO YOU CAN DELEGATE COMPLETE
FILE TO ALL THE PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE...
SO I SAID THAT THIS IS --
YOU STILL NEED FROM, TIME TO TIME, CONFIG
STRUCTURE.
LIKE, THIS IS A LOOP, TO INSTALL APACHE, SO THIS IS
A LOOP.
WHICH IS NICE.
IS THAT THE LOOP BY THEMSELVES CAN BE DONE WITH A
PLUGIN.
SO YOU HAVE A PLUGIN FOR LOOPS.
THIS IS NOT CALLED A LOOP PLUGINS.
IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO FURTHER, OR IN TWO
DAYS, FEEL FREE.
SO THIS IS -- THIS IS CALLED -- THIS IS -- WAIT.
THIS IS IMPLEMENTED USING A FUNCTION LOOK UP.
WHICH IS REALLY USEABLE IN GINGER.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO PART, THE
FIRST ONE IS LOOKING AT UNVARIABLE FROM AN
ENVIRONMENT.
AND THIS ONE IS USING THE SAME CODE, BUT CHOOSING
DIFFERENT NOTATION, AND IT SHOULD RESULT IN THE
SAME OUTPUT, TECHNICALLY THE SAME, BUT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR MY PRESENTATION.
SO IF YOU WANT TO ADD YOUR OWN LOOK UP FOR WHATEVER
YOU WANT, OR YOU CAN USE IT AS A LOOP.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THE CODE IS THERE.
IT'S FIVE LINE OF CODE.
AND FOUR LINE OF BOILERPLATES AND 20 LINE OF
LICENSE.
SO YOU CAN INSTRUCT SPECIFIC -- YOU CAN EXTRACT
SPECIFIC DATA.
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN EXTRACT PASSWORD.
WHICH IS NICE BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVER NEED TO
COMMUNICATE.
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE SAME PASSWORD.
AND IF IT NEVER LEAVES -- IF IT NEVER LEAVES THE
SERVER, IT'S BETTER.
NO LEAK.
NO ANYTHING.
AND YOU CAN JUST REMOVE IT AND CHANGE IT --
[NO AUDIO]
IF YOU ARE A BIG COMPANY, OR YOU HAVE A PROPER
POWER AND EVERYTHING AND DATABASE, STRONG DATABASE,
YOU KNOW, WHEN --
IT'S BETTER TO HAVE MULTIPLE COPY.
HAVING DIFFERENT INFORMATION IN DIFFERENT DATABASE.
SO, AGAIN, IT'S QUITE EASY.
YOU NEED TO CREATE A PYTHON MODULE.
MOST OF THE TIME THIS IS ALWAYS STARTING BY PYTHON
MODULE.
CREATE A --
[AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
AND QR DOCUMENTS.
AND YOU JUST RETURN THE DATA.
IT'S -- YOU CAN CHECK THE CODE, FOR EXAMPLE, AGAIN,
THESE ARE VERY SIMPLE ONE, WITH FIVE LINES OF
INTERESTING CODE, LIKE, ENVIRONMENT PLUGIN, WHICH
IS JUST ONE LINE, AND GIVING --
AND ONE WAY TO EXTEND ANSIBLE IS JUST TO USE YOUR
OWN ANSIBLE MODULE.
SO WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING IN SHARE IS BETTER TO DO
IT IN PYTHON.
I DO NOT NEED TO GO INTO THAT.
IT'S EASIER BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN HAVE A PROPER
WRITTEN CODE AND INFORMATION AND EVERYTHING.
LIKE PYTHON, IT'S INCLUDED.
SO YOU HAVE LOTS AND LOTS.
ONE NAME -- SO FOR PEOPLE USING, YOU WILL NOT BE
SURPRISED, THIS WAS DONE BY YOUR X -- PEOPLE.
AND ANSIBLE IS A PYTHON SCRIPT.
OBVIOUSLY.
DOCUMENTATION GOING CALLED DOCUMENTATION, WHICH IS
USED ON THE WEBSITE, AND SOME COMMAND LINE TO SHOW
EVERYTHING.
AND ITS FUNCTION, MAIN, THE REASON ANSIBLE MODEL
YOU NEED TO -- WITH DOCUMENT SPECIFICATION, SO YOU
CAN SEE WHICH IS MANDATORY, WHICH IS NOT MANDATORY.
YOU CAN HAVE A COMPLEX SYSTEM WITH INCAPABILITY.
IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT, THERE IS A DIGITAL,
I PREFER TO HAVE A MODEL, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, NOT
EVERYBODY LISTEN TO ME, SO SOME PEOPLE DO VERY
COMPLEX MODEL WITH THIS KIND OF PERIMETER.
AND THEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ANSIBLE USING A
MODULE EXGISM.
FAIL WHEN YOU FAIL AND EXIT WHEN YOU DO NOT FAIL.
SO THAT'S QUITE OBVIOUS.
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF, WHICH IS IT NEEDS TO BE
CURTAIN WITH THE PYTHON.
SO FOR --
SOME ANSIBLE CUSTOMER ARE USING WEB FIDE.
I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE CHECKING THAT QUITE -- THEY
DO NOT CHECK THAT MUCH, BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO IN
CUL, I THINK THAT'S FINE.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANSIBLE, IT
NEEDS TO BE PYTHON, OR YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL THEY
DECIDE TO STOP FOR WEB FIDE.
MAYBE IN TEN YEARS.
SO SORRY.
EXIT REMOTELY.
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IT SEND TO A SYSTEM, PYTHON.
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIST IS DONE, SO YOU
DO NOT NEED TO STOP -- SIO OR --
IF POSSIBLE, USE STANDARD STUFF.
[AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
BECAUSE THIS LINE IS, THERE WAS A SEARCH AND
REPLACE FOR THE WORD FOR THE MODULE, SO IT BE RUN
USING ONE SINGLE FILE.
SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS ISSUE CHANGED, LIKE ADD
ONE MORE SPACE OR JUST REMOVE, OR WHATEVER.
IT WILL NOT WORK.
IT WILL COMPLAIN.
THEN IF YOU WANT TO TEST, WHICH IS ONE SCRIPT.
WHICH IS A TEST MODULE.
WHEN I DID FIRST PRESENTATION, I NEED TO SHOW THEY
ARE LISTENING TO ME AND DOING THEIR PROPER
DOCUMENTATION AND EVERYTHING.
SO THIS IS A SCRIPT, YOU CAN USE, FIGURE OUT,
SCRIPTING TEST.
THAT WAS OUR FIRST SESSION TODAY ABOUT THIS.
SO TODAY -- SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT DO REAL LIVE
TESTING.
IF YOU NEED 1,000 VM AND MAYBE IT'S QUITE
EXPENSIVE.
I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE USING MOCK TESTING.
IT RUNS EVERY MONTH LIKE THIS.
SOMETIMES, WHATEVER -- IF YOU WANT TO GO BEYOND,
LIKE, YOU WANT TO EXECUTE SOMETHING REMOTELY, WANT
TO EXECUTE ON MY LAPTOP, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
AND THANKS FOR ASKING IT, BECAUSE THERE WAS AN
ACTION PLUGIN.
ON THE CLIENT SIDE, SO FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU WANT
TO COMPUTE SOMETHING, WHERE YOU NEED TO EXECUTE IT,
FROM THE SYSTEM, JUST TO OPEN THE FILE, OR IF YOU
WANT TO DO SOME COMPUTING, AGAIN, DONE ON THE
CLIENT SIDE.
SO, AGAIN, THIS IS A PYTHON MODEL.
AGAIN, YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC OR CLASS TO IMPLEMENT.
AND, AGAIN, YOU HAVE A FUNCTION CALLED RUN.
AND YOU NEED TO RETURN THE WIZARD TO EXECUTION.
AS I SAID, THIS IS EXECUTED ON THE CLIENT SIDE.
IT'S NOT -- BECAUSE EVERYTHING INTERESTING I'VE
ALREADY DONE, BUT IF YOU HAVE AN ID, YOU CAN DO IT.
THE ONLY PROBLEM, YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
ANSIBLE INTERNALS, LIKE TEN PARAMETERS, AND IT'S
DOCUMENTED IN THE CODE, BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH IPI
FOR THAT.
AND I DO NOT THINK IT'S TABLE YET.
BUT YOU CAN ASK THEM.
THEY HAVE A BOOTH IN THE EXPO.
SO, YEAH.
EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO, EXCEPT -- FINISH, AND RUN.
AND FOR THAT, WE HAVE A CALL BACK PLUGIN, WHICH IS
DOING EXECUTION.
WITH IT, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.
FOR EXAMPLE, LOOK FOR SOMETHING IN A FILE.
YOU CAN -- I KNOW YOUR COWORKER BY POSTING, OR
WHATEVER YOU ARE USING, STACK.
TESTING YOUR -- SENDING YOUR SMS, WHATEVER.
AGAIN MODEL.
AND AGAIN, YOU NEED TO FOLLOW SPECIFIC METHOD.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE OMITTED PLAYBOOK.
IT'S QUITE --
THERE IS ONE THAT YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE, AND YOU
CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.
THIS IS RUNNING --
SO I WENT FURTHER THAN I -- I WENT FASTER THAN I
EXPECTED.
SO I HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS.
YOU CAN EXTEND.
SINCE I THINK EVERYONE --
EACH TIME YOU CONNECT WITH SERVER, IT WILL GET --
IT GOES WHAT TYPE OF VERSION IT IS.
IS IT RUNNING.
IP ADDRESS AND EVERYTHING.
AND NOW WE CAN START THAT ON -- STORE THAT ON A
FILE.
I THINK IT'S ALREADY DATABASE.
SO MUCH STUFF WHERE YOU CAN PUT DATA.
SO YOU CAN PUT IT.
YOU JUST NEED TO WRITE TO MODEL.
NOT THIS ONE, BECAUSE I ALREADY DID.
BUT YOU CAN STORE THAT.
YOU JUST NEED TO WRITE A MODEL FOR THAT.
THERE IS A SHARE PLUGIN, WHICH IS SOMETHING I
DIDN'T LOOK AT.
MOSTLY USE TO MAKE ANSIBLE RUN, AND ON WINDOWS.
I DIDN'T LOOK, SO IT'S...
AND ALSO IS A PLUGIN FOR A VARIABLE, SO YOU CAN
DECIDE TO INJECT VARIABLE USING MORE THAN JUST YAML
FIDE.
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY USE FOR THAT, BUT IF YOU DO,
IT'S QUITE EASY.
SO THERE IS THIS KIND OF PLUGIN.
AND NEW VERSION OF ANSIBLE COMING, SO A DIFFERENT
VERSION, CURRENTLY 1.9.
AND THEY WANT TO REFACTOR EVERYTHING.
AND THERE IS --
[AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
AND FOR PEOPLE --
[AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
SOMEWHERE IN THE BUILDING, SO YOU CAN JUST...
[AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
START WITH THE WEB SERVER AND EVERYTHING.
AND CHANGE THE INTERFACE.
THEY'RE GOING TO REFACTOR, MAYBE SOME STUFF I SAID
INTERNAL WILL BE CHANGE.
AND SINCE THIS IS NOT DOCUMENTED, BUT I DO NOT WANT
TO BREAK TOO MUCH.
IF YOU ARE ALREADY WALKING, GO DISCUSS WITH THEM.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION, I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT
MOMENT.
AND IF YOU DON'T, YOU CAN JUST MAKE SOME UPLOADS
FOR ME FOR FIVE MINUTES.
IT'S GOOD FOR MY EGO.
[APPLAUSE]
>> SO WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS.
IF YOU GOT ONE, THERE'S A MICROPHONE RIGHT THERE.
>> AUDIENCE: YEAH, I ACTUALLY GOT ONE.
I AM CURRENTLY TRANSFERRING TO USING ANSIBLE FOR
SOME OF MY STUFF AT WORK.
AND I'M FINDING THAT I HAVE A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME
IF I HAVE JUST TWO LITTLE SHELF OF SCRIPTS THAT I
CAN SET IN ANSIBLE.
A LIST OF VARIABLES THERE'S NOT AN EASY WAY TO WRAP
TWO SCRIPTS.
IT DEPENDS ON A SPECIFIC MODULE.
IS THERE A WAY OF USING THE SAME VARIABLES WITHOUT
REPLAY THEM ON TWO MODULES IN A ROW?
>> I THINK THAT YOU CAN USE -- IT'S SHELL SCRIPT,
AND YOU WANT TO, IF I'M, YOU WANT TO SEND THEM AND
REUSE VARIABLE.
FOR THE SAME.
HMM.
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE SEND SOME FILE AND WRITE
THEM AS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.
OR I WOULD JUST -- REWRITE EVERYTHING AS PYTHON AND
THEN I CAN USE THEM AS ANSIBLE VARIABLE.
>> AUDIENCE: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I DID.
OKAY.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A WAY.
IF YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM, YOU CAN USE
-- NO.
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A WAY.
>> AUDIENCE: THANKS.
>> QUESTION?
I CAN'T ANSWER EVERYTHING, BUT AT LEAST I CAN TRY.
OKAY.
>> AUDIENCE: YEAH, I'M USING ANSIBLE, TOO.
AND I WANT -- I'M TEST TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT.
IS THERE ANY WAY TO TEST PLAYBOOK?
>> TO WHAT?
>> AUDIENCE: I WANT TO TEST.
IS THERE ANY WAY TO TEST MAKING --
>> YOU ARE USING TAGS AND YOU WANT TO TEST TAGS
ACTIVATED, YOU DO NOT GO WITH JUST STUFF LIKE
CREATING VM.
AND YOU JUST DO THAT.
YOU CAN JUST CHANGE THE -- WHAT I DO IS I RUN
EVERYTHING IN TRAY VS, AND MAKE SURE I USE
NON-DIRECT CHANGE BECAUSE I PREFER TO MAKE SURE
THAT MY AUTOMATION DO NOT DESTROY EVERYTHING.
AND WHAT YOU CAN DO, JUST DECIDE TO USE A DIFFERENT
INVENTORY OR SET OF SERVER.
SO WAIT FOR YOUR TEST TO RUN ON A SPECIFIC OPEN
CLOUD OR WORK SPACE OR WHATEVER, AND YOU DO NOT
TOUCH PRODUCTION.
AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS MORE THAN THIS.
I DO HAVE YAMLI WHICH IS TESTING EVERYTHING.
BUT --
YOU CAN DO THAT IN VM OR THIS KIND OF STUFF.
BESIDES THAT, NO, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC MAGIC FOR
TESTING.
YOU JUST NEED TO GIVE IT TEST VM.
PEOPLE LOOKING AT SEVERAL SPEC.
>> OKAY.
SO THANKS FOR LISTENING.
[APPLAUSE]
