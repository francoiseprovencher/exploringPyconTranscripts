
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> HEY, EVERYONE, SORRY FOR THE DELAY HERE.  AS A FORMER BOSS OF MINE USED TO SAY, TECHNOLOGY WILL FUCK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
SO, PUTTING THAT OUT HERE IN CASE WE DON'T MAKE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITHOUT ANY GLITCHES THANKS FOR HAVING ME.  I AM AS I WAS INTRODUCED THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZING AT CODE FOR AMERICA.  BUT BEFORE I WORKED AT CODE FOR AMERICA I WORKED ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
[APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.  I GUESS YOU CAN DO THAT IN CANADA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT TO BE CLEAR, CODE FOR AMERICA IS A NON-PARTISAN ORGANIZATION.  BUT WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH WAS -- WILL GO DOWN AS THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENTS FOR THE PAST 75 YEARS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET DONE AND HAVE FAILED.  AND HE GOT IT DONE.  WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT.
BUT --
[APPLAUSE]
YOU GUYS ARE SO ACTIVE.  THIS IS GREAT.  YEAH, BUT ALMOST FELL APART.  NOT BECAUSE OF OBSTRUCTIONISM IN CONGRESS, ALMOST FELL APART BECAUSE OF A BROKEN WEBSITE.  THINK ABOUT THAT.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY ALMOST FAILED BECAUSE A WEBSITE DIDN'T WORK.  NOW, IT WAS HIGH ENOUGH PROFILE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO BRING TOGETHER SOME OF THE MOST TALENTED TECHNOLOGISTS IN THE COUNTRY WHO WORKED LITERALLY AROUND THE CLOCK FOR MONTHS TO GET IT BACK UP AND RUNNING.  IT WORKS NOW.  THANKFULLY.  BUT THIS IS NOT AN ANOMALY THIS IS REALLY HEALTH CARE.GOV IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.  94% OF GOVERNMENT I.T. PROJECTS THAT COST MORE THAN $10 MILLION ARE EITHER DELIVERED LATE OR DELIVERED OVER BUDGET OR FLAT OUT DON'T WORK.
AND MOST OF THEM AFFECT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOT MORE URGENT NEEDS AND LOT LESS OF A VOICE THAN THOSE OF US IN THIS ROOM DO.
AS EZRA SAID, AT THE AT THIS TIME, ONE PRIVILEGE THE INSURED AND WELL-OFF HAVE IS TO EXCUSE THE TERRIBLE QUALITY OF SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT ROUTINELY DELIVERS TO THE POOR.  TOO OFTEN THE PRESS IGNORES THE PAIN AND TROUBLE OF INTERFACING THAT THE POOR STRUGGLE WITH DAILY.  SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT INTERACT WITH GOVERNMENT ON A DAILY BASIS, YOU KNOW, FOR ME IT'S -- BESIDES OBVIOUS STUFF LIKE WALKING ON SIDEWALKS AND THAT SORT OF THING I TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.  THAT'S ABOUT IT.  I DON'T HAVE KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL, I'M NOT ON SOCIAL SERVICE BENEFITS, I HAVE NEVER HAD TO SIGN UP FOR GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSURANCE.  BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR WHO MAY BE HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE TRYING TO APPLY FOR FOOD STAMPS, WHOSE KIDS TO GO PUBLIC SCHOOL, HAVE TO RIDE FOUR BUSES ONE WAY TO GET TO WORK.  GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK FOR THOSE PEOPLE.  EVEN MORE THAN WE THINK IT DOESN'T WORK FOR US.
IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME LESS HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLES, OF HOW THIS PLAYS OUT, THIS IS A STORY FROM FLORIDA, WHO IS FROM FLORIDA IN THE ROOM?
GREAT.  YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE HEARING ABOUT THIS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS STORY AT THE END 20613 THE STATE OF FLORIDA ROLLED OUT A NEW UNEMPLOYMENT WEBSITE, NOW ALL OF FLORIDIANS WHO WANT TO SIGN UP FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS HAD TO GO TO THIS WEBSITE.  THEY COULD NO LONGER CALL OR TO GO AN OFFICE.  THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH THE WEBSITE.
SO IT ROLLED OUT AND A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER THE STATE OF FLORIDA WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED TO SEE THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS FALLING, PRECIPITOUSLY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY.  THEY FINALLY REALIZED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THE WEBSITE THAT PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO USE TO SIGN UP WASN'T WORKING.  THOUSANDS OF FLORIDIANS WHO DEPEND ON THAT FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK TO FEED THEIR KIDS AND THERE WAS NO ONE THEY COULD PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL AND TELL THAT THEY WEREN'T GETTING THINK BENEFITS.  THIS COSTS THE STATE OF FLORIDA $63 MILLION.
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, I DON'T KNOW FAVORITE IS THE RIGHT WORD.  THIS PAST FALL THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ROLLED OUT A DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM THAT WAS MEANT TO MAKE A COMPREHENSIVE RECORD OF EVERY  STUDENT FROM PUBLIC SCHOOL THROUGH 12TH GRADE.  GRADES, CLASS SCHEDULES, ATTENDANCE RECORDS, EVERYTHING.  THIS TOOL WAS SUPPOSED TO ROLL OUT IN 2007.  IT ROLLED OUT IF YOU'RE DOING THE MATH SEVEN YEARS LATE.  AND OF COURSE OVER BUDGET.  AT THE TIME IT ROLLED OUT THE THEY WERE WORKING WITH A SECOND CONTRACTOR THEY WERE IN LITIGATION WITH THE FIRST CONTRACTOR.  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE VERY SOON AFTER IT ROLLED OUT IT CRASHED.  WHAT THIS MEANT FOR STUDENTS THEY COULDN'T GET CLASS SCHEDULES, IN THIS CASE IN JEFFERSON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SPENT FIRST TWO WEEKS OF CLASSES SITTING IN THE AUDITORIUM.
SENIORS WHO WERE APPLYING TO COLLEGE COULDN'T GET -- HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THEIR APPLICATIONS.
THIS COSTS THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT $130 MILLION THAT IS AS OF A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.  THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.
AND THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE, THIS IS FROM ARIZONA BUT THIS IS TRUE OF JUST ABOUT EVERY STATE'S SOCIAL SERVICE BENEFITS WEBSITE WHERE YOU GO TO SIGN UP FOR FOOD STAMPS.  YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE IT HERE BUT THIS BLURB SAYS THE WEB PAGE IS UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE FEDERAL DATA SOURCES ARE NOT AVAILABLE DURING THE FOLLOWING TIMES.  MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 11 P.M. TO 3 A.M. ARIZONA TIME,  SATURDAY AND SUNDAY 9:00 P.M. TO 3:00 A.M. ARIZONA TIME BECAUSE NO ONE WHO IS TRYING TO SIGN UP FOR FOOD STAMP WOULD WANT TO USE THE SIGN-UP FORM DURING THOSE TIMES.  I'M NOT A TECHNOLOGIST, I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DATABASE ADMINISTRATION BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY A DATABASE WOULD BE CLOSED.  AT REGULAR PERIODS.
[APPLAUSE]
SO, I FEEL LIKE ACTUALLY WOULD BE CHEAPER TO JUST KEEP IT ON ALL THE TIME.  BUT AGAIN, I DON'T WORK WITH THESE THINGS.  TO KEEP THEM COOL, IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT IS ARIZONA.  THE STATE OF LOUISIANA ACTUALLY THEIR BENEFITS SIGN UP FORM WAS DOWN FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH EARLIER THIS YEAR.
SO, A LOT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THESE STATISTICS IN THE U.S.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST TRUST IN GOVERNMENT PRETTY MUCH SINCE THE CIVIL WAR, SINCE THESE STATISTICS HAVE BEEN KEPT.  THE LOWEST VOTER TURN OUT SINCE WORLD WAR II, I THINK YOU CAN DRAW DIRECT LINE BETWEEN THESE NUMBERS AND THE STORIES I JUST TOLD YOU.
IT'S AT LEAST AT MUCH ABOUT THIS SENSE OF INCOMPETENT ABOUT IDEOLOGY.  WE HAVE THE SENSE THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK.  ESPECIALLY IN A TIME WHEN WE'RE ABLE AND ACCUSTOMED TO BEING ABLE TO GET THE STORE OF THE WORLD'S KNOWLEDGE IN THE PALM OF OUR HANDS.
OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW GOVERNMENT WORK AND GOVERNMENT'S CAPACITIES TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS ARE GROWING INCREASINGLY WIDE.  AND THAT'S NOT JUST A BAD THING FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SIGN UP FOR BENEFITS FROM 10:00 P.M. TO 3:00 A.M. MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY IT'S DANGEROUS FOR DEMOCRACY.  IT BREEDS CYNICISM.  WE NEED GOVERNMENT TO WORK.  NOT JUST POLITICS BUT THE BUREAUCRACY.  IN THE 21ST CENTURY GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO DO DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION WELL.  AS OUR FRIEND TOM THE FOUNDER OF CIVIC TECH COMPANY CALLED MY IS SOCIETY SAID GOOD GOVERNANCE AND GOOD POLICY ARE NOW INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE DIGITAL.  WITHOUT INCORPORATING MUCH DIGITAL FROM THE START.  THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK OURSELVES AT CODE FOR AMERICA.  HOW TO YOU BRIDGE THIS GAP AS CITIZENS OF HOW SERVICES SHOULD BE DELIVERED AND GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO DELIVER ON THOSE EXPECTATIONS.  AND HOW DO WE HELP GOVERNMENT MAKE USE OF THIS NEW REVOLUTIONARY TOOL SET THAT WE KNOW HAS CHANGED EVERY INDUSTRY IN OUR LIVES, MOSTLY FOR THE BETTER, CERTAINLY EMPOWERED CITIZENS.  THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE FOR GOVERNMENT AND IT MAKES SENSE FOR DEMOCRACY.
SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A REALLY BIG PROBLEM.  BUT WE'RE REALLY HOPEFUL AT CODE FOR AMERICA.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS TRUE.  WE BELIEVE GOVERNMENT CAN WORK.  WE'VE SEEN IT WORK.  BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US BRINGING ALL OF OUR SKILLS TO THE TABLE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT WORK.  THERE IS NO CODE RED NINJA SQUAD COMING TO SAVE US EVERY TIME A GOVERNMENT WEBSITE BREAKS.
THIS IS LAUREN.  IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT YOU SHOULD GOOGLE THIS "STOP WAITING FOR PERMISSION" SHE WROTE ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE, SHE IS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER BY TRAINING WHO LIVES IN PHILADELPHIA.  AND A FEW YEARS AGO SHE SHOWED UP AT A HACK-A-THON IN PHILADELPHIA AROUND EDUCATION.  IT WAS HOSTED BY THE CODE FOR AMERICA BRIGADE CHAPTER IN PHILADELPHIA.  I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THE CODE FOR AMERICA BRIGADE IS OUR CITIZEN VOLUNTEER PROGRAM.
SHE SHOWED UP, NOT BECAUSE SHE HAD ANY CODING SKILLS OR WANTED TO BRUSH THEM UP BUT BECAUSE SHE CARED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE CITY'S FAILING PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING SHE COULD DO ABOUT IT.  SHE GOT THERE AND SHE WAS ENCOURAGED TO BRUSH UP ON HER REALLY RUSTY HTML AND CSS SKILLS AND BUILT A VISUALIZATION OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BUDGET THAT WEEKEND.  SHE WAS JUST HOOKED.  SHE FELT EMPOWERED TO DO MORE.  AND SO SHE KEPT COMING TO OUR -- THE CODE FOR PHILLY'S WEEKLY MEETINGS, AND EVENTUALLY SHE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO FIX A PROBLEM OR ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT SHE AND MANY OF HER FRIENDS EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY MOVED TO NEW NEIGHBORHOODS IN PHILADELPHIA.  WHICH IS THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PARKING RULES ARE OF DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS.  AND IT'S REALLY -- THAT DATA THAT THE CITY HAS IS REALLY HARD TO EXTRACT FROM ITS WEBSITE.
SO LAUREN BASICALLY IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK TAUGHT HERSELF JAVA SCRIPT AND GIS AND THREW TOGETHER THIS MAP THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE AND HER FRIENDS WOULD USE.  AND SHE TWEETED IT OUT ON A FRIDAY, ON MONDAY AFTERNOON SHE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE PARKING OFFICE OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA TALKING ABOUT MORE WAYS THAT THEY COULD MAKE THEIR DATA MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CITIZENS.
AND NOW A FEW -- SEVERAL MONTHS LATER LAUREN IS A DATA SCIENTIST WORKING FOR THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA.
[APPLAUSE]
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF HER.  THIS IS TIFFANY.  TIFFANY WAS A FELLOW AT CODE FOR AMERICA LAST YEAR AND OUR FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IS A YEAR OF PUBLIC SERVICE.  FULL TIME PUBLIC SERVICE WHERE TECHNOLOGISTS TAKE A YEAR OFF FROM THEIR JOBS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO COME WORK WITH CITY GOVERNMENTS AND TEAMS OF THREE TO ADDRESS A CERTAIN PROBLEM OR ISSUE.  AND TIFFANY WAS ASSIGNED TO WORK WITH THE CITY OF ATLANTA TO STREAMLINE THEIR COURT SYSTEM.
BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FELLOWSHIP HERE LAST SUMMER A STORY CROSSED HER TWITTER FEED, MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THIS, THERE WERE MANY DETROITERS WHOSE WATER WAS GETTING SHUT OFF BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY WATER BILL.  TIFFANY DID, WHAT MANY OF US DO, FOLLOWED THE STORY ON TWITTER STARTED HAVING CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE DONE.  HER FRIEND CHRISTIE SAID, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO HELP OUT BUT I WANT TO KNOW THAT MY MONEY IS GOING ACTUALLY TO HELP PEOPLE PAY THEIR WATER BILLS.  AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRUST THE VERACITY OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, IF I GIVE TO THIS CHARITY IT WILL END UP IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED IT.
AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THEY DECIDED, YOU KNOW WHAT, INSTEAD OF JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS ON TWITTER, LET'S GO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  SO, TIFFANY AND CHRISTIE -- TIFFANY TOOK HER EXPERIENCE WORKING INSIDE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDING THE BACK END OF GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS TO BUILD DETROIT WATER PROJECT.  AS ANYONE HEARD OF DETROIT WATER PROJECT?
[APPLAUSE]
GREAT.  SO, DETROIT WATER PROJECT HAS HELPED OVER 900 FAMILIES IN DETROIT TO PAY OVER $170,000 WORTH OF WATER BILLS AND IT JUST GRADUATED AS ONE OF THE FIRST NON-PROFITS IN THE VERY FIRST CIVIC TECH COMPANY TO GRADUATE FROM -- EXPANDING TO BALTIMORE VERY HAPPY FOR TIFFANY.  WHAT YOU SEE IN BOTH LAUREN'S STORY AND TIFFANY'S STORY IS THE SENSE THAT WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT WE FEEL IS BROKEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES, WE CAN USE OUR SKILLS TO HELP FIX IT AND THAT'S THE STEER WRIT THAT ANIMATES THE CODE FOR AMERICA BRIGADE PROGRAM.  WHERE OVER 100 CHAPTERS AROUND THE WORLD, WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS THAT WORK WITH US THROUGH OUR INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM CODE FOR ALL.  AND THE BRIGADES WHAT THEY DO THEY MEET WEEKLY, SO IT'S NOT JUST A SET OF HACK-A-THONS, AND THEY PARTNER WITH GOVERNMENT.  THEY CAN UNDERSTAND BOTH THE PROBLEM SET AND THE SYSTEMS, WHAT'S POSSIBLE, WHAT'S REALISTIC AND REALLY DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIZENS WHO CARE ABOUT FIXING PROBLEMS AND GOVERNMENT WHO REALLY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CAPACITY OF THE COMMUNITY.
SO HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT BRIG GAIT BUILDS, THIS IS LOCAL FREE WEB OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO.  WAY FOR SAN FRANCISCANS TO FIND FREE INTERNET ENABLED COMPUTERS BY TEXTING THEIR BUS STOP I.D. TO A NUMBER WHICH WILL RETURN THE CLOSEST FREE INTERNET ENABLED COMPUTER.
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM OAKLAND WHERE I LIVE.  IT'S CALLED ADOPT A DRAIN.  IT WAS ACTUALLY MORPHED FROM ANOTHER PROJECT THAT WAS BUILT IN BOSTON IN 2011 CALLED ADOPT A HYDRANT.  WHEN OUR FELLOWS SHOWED UP IN BOSTON IN FEBRUARY OF 2011 I GUESS LIKE EVERY FEBRUARY IT FEELS, THERE WAS A MASSIVE SNOWSTORM.  AND THE CITY WAS CLOSED ON THEIR FIRST DAY.  SO THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO, THEY REALIZED WHEN THE PLOWS CAME THROUGH THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD THEY BURIED THE FIRE HYDRANTS.  THEY THOUGHT, IF THERE WERE A FIRE ON OUR BLOCK THEN THE FIREFIGHTERS WOULD HAVE TO DIG OUT THE FIRE HYDRANT BEFORE THEY PUT OUT THE FIRE.  THAT'S SILLY.  I'M RIGHT HERE.  I HAVE NOTHING TO DO TODAY.  I COULD JUST DIG OUT THAT FIRE HYDRANT MYSELF.  WHY DON'T WE ALLOW CITIZENS AWAY TO ADOPT A FIRE HYDRANTS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DIGGING THEM OUT.  WHEN IT SNOWS.
THEY DID.  IT WAS REALLY POPULAR.  IT'S NOT LIKE A BIG DEAL.  BUT IT ALSO WAS REDEPLOYED IN DOZENS OF CITIES AND IT WAS REDEPLOYED TO ADOPT TSUNAMI SIRENS, HERE IN OAKLAND TO ADOPT STORM DRAINS AS WE KNOW IT DOESN'T RAIN THAT MUCH IN THE BAY AREA RIGHT NOW.  WHICH MEANS THAT STORM DRAINS GET CLOGGED WITH TRASH AND WHEN IT DOS RAIN THE STREETS FLOOD.
INSTEAD OF SENDING PUBLIC WORKS EMPLOYEES AROUND TO ALL OF THE STORM DRAINS TO CLEAN THEM -- DRAINS TO CLEAN THEM OUT THEY ALLOWED CITIZENS TO DIG OUT STORM DRAINS.  NOW WHEN IT RAINS, I GET AN E-MAIL FROM THE CITY, FROM THE PUBLIC WORK DEPARTMENT, THAT SAYS, IT'S ABOUT TO RAIN, YOU SHOULD GO CHECK YOUR STORM DRAIN.  SO I WALK AROUND THE CORNER, I CHECK MY STORM DRAIN, IF THERE IS TRASH I PULL IT OUT.  THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE ORANGE VEST THAT YOU CAN WEAR AND LIKE A TRASH PICKER.  THERE'S USUALLY NO TRASH IN MY STORM DRAIN I JUST GO BACK HOME.
IT'S NOT -- IT TAKES MAYBE FIVE MINUTES TO DO, IT DOESN'T RAIN THAT OFTEN.  BUT IT'S THE SENSE OF CONNECTION AND RESPONSIBILITY I FEEL FOR MY CITY.  I TOLD YOU THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.  I WARNED YOU.
THAT SENSE OF CONNECTION AND RESPONSIBILITY I FEEL FOR MY CITY.  NOT JUST GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO DO THIS WORK IT'S ALL OF OUR JOBS.
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROJECT CALLED BALANCE, WE WORKED WITH THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN SAN FRANCISCO TO PILOT THIS ARE NOW TRYING TO ROLL IT OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.  IF YOU'RE ON FOOD STAMP IT'S NOT EASY TOE CHECK YOUR BALANCE.  YOU GET A LITTLE, EBT CARD LIKE ATM CARD YOU USE IT TO SWIPE AT THE GROCERY STORE.
BUT THERE'S NO LIKE ONLINE BANKING, THERE'S NO MINT FOR EBT.  THE EASIEST WAY TO CHECK YOUR BALANCE TO GO TO -- OTHER THAN GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE CROSSING YOUR FINGERS HOPING YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GO TO AN ATM, PUT -- SOME LIKE THE STATE HAS CONTRACT WITH CERTAIN NUMBER OF BANKS, YOU GO TO THE ATM, PUT YOUR CARD IN, TELL YOU YOUR BALANCE BACK.  NOT WITHDRAWING MONEY JUST CHECKING YOUR BALANCE.
EVERY TIME AN EBT COMPLIANT DOES THAT, THE BANK CHARGES THEM 75 CENTS.
IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR, IN 2014, BANKS MADE $20 MILLION, 75 CENTS AT A TIME.  I KNEW THAT WOULD GET A REACTION.
OF COURSE THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  AND SO OUR HEALTH TEAM ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT A BRIGADE PROJECT IT WAS BUILT BY OUR HEALTH LAB AT CODE FOR AMERICA, IT'S BEEN DEPLOYED IN THREE OTHER STATES BY OUR BRIGADES YOU TEXT YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, SIGN UP, TEXT IN YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, RETURNS YOUR BALANCE IT'S FREE.  ALSO ALMOST FREE FOR US.  THIS DOESN'T COST A LOT OF MONEY.
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT -- ACTUALLY ALL OF THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS WHERE THE CODE HAS BEEN BUILT IN ONE PLACE AND THEN EASILY REDEPLOYED SOMEWHERE ELSE.
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE CODE THAT IS SPREADING IT'S THE SENSIBILITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN WORK AND SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE THAT SIT SENSE CAN -- CITIZENS CAN DO TO MAKE IT WORK.  NONE OF THESE PROJECTS ON THEIR OWN ARE GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE BUREAUCRACY THE WAY WE NEED IT TO BE REVOLUTIONIZED.  BALANCE IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE HUNGER OR GET PEOPLE OFF OF FOOD STAMPS.  ALL OF THESE PROJECTS KNIT TOGETHER AND OVER TIME REPRESENT NOT JUST THE CAPACITY TO FIX WHAT'S BROKEN WITH GOVERNMENT.  IT REPRESENTS WHAT THE PRACTICE OF DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE IN THE 21ST CENTURY.  TO USE THEIR HANDS TO FIX THE GOVERNMENT, IN COLLABORATION WITH GOVERNMENT.  TO MAKE COMMUNITIES HEALTHIER, TO MAKE GOVERNMENTS MORE RESPONSIVE AND TO MAKE DEMOCRACY STRONGER.
SO, HOPEFULLY BY NOW YOU ALSO AGREE WITH US THAT THIS STATEMENT IS TRUE, GOVERNMENT CAN WORK BUT THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US, LENDING OUR SKILLS, WHETHER WE CAN CODE OR NOT.  WHETHER YOU HAVE TWO HOURS ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR TWO YEARS, IT'S ON US TO FIX WHAT IS BROKEN ABOUT DEMOCRACY.
I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU WILL COME JOIN US.  I WOULD NOT BE A GOOD COMMUNITY ORGANIZER IF I DIDN'T HAVE A REALLY HARD ASK FOR YOU GUYS.  MY MARKETING TEAM WAS TRYING TO GET ME TO CUT THIS DOWN TO THREE THINGS, I SAID "NO" BUT NO, BUT WE MADE IT EASY.  GO TO THIS LINK RIGHT NOW YOU CAN DO ALL OF THESE THINGS.  YOU CAN JOIN A BRIGADE  IN YOUR CITY, PROBABLY ONE WHERE YOU LIVE BUT IF NOT YOU CAN START ONE.  YOU CAN APPLY FOR THE FELLOWSHIP FOR 2016 STARTS IN JANUARY.  YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT HOW TO APPLY FOR A TECH JOB IN GOVERNMENT.  YOU CAN BECOME LIKE LAUREN.  OR IF YOU'RE NOT FROM THE U.S. YOU CAN LAUNCH A CODE-FOR PROJECT IN YOUR COUNTRY THROUGH OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM, CODE FOR ALL.  WE ALSO HAVE WHAT WE CALL A CIVIC TECH ISSUE FINDER IF YOU SCROLL DOWN ON THAT PAGE YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE SURFACED ALL OF THE ISSUE FROM CIVIC TECH PROJECTS ACROSS OUR NETWORK, THAT ARE LOOKING FOR HELP AND YOU CAN CODE FOR AMERICA RIGHT NOW.  SO, I HOPE THAT YOU'LL JOIN US.
I HOPE THAT YOU SEE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK.  BUT ALSO REALLY FUN.  AND REALLY REWARDING.  THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE WE'RE DOING QUESTIONS?
IS THAT RIGHT?
ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS I'M HERE UNTIL THEY TELL ME I HAVE TO GET OFF THE STAGE.  DO YOU LIKE OUR NEW FLAG GIF?
GIF.
>> READY TO GO?
>> HI.
>> GREAT TALK.
>> THANK YOU.  YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE CLICK A NEIGHBORHOOD THING.
>> CLICK THAT HOOD IS REALLY FUN.  PEOPLE GET REALLY WORKED UP ABOUT WHERE THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARIES ARE DRAWN.  SO -- WE'VE HAD SOME REAL EXCITEMENT AROUND THIS LITTLE GAME THAT LET'S YOU DEFINE THE BOUNDARIES OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND PEOPLE -- IF YOU COMMENT SECTIONS YOU SHOULD SEE THEM THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THE CLICK-A-HOOD SEEMS LIKE EXAMPLE OF WAY THAT AN APP CAN DO A THING SORT OF INSTEAD OF GOVERNMENT.  I THINK WE HAVE DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS ABOUT WHERE GOVERNMENT WILL BE SAY IN A HUNDRED YEARS, SOME OF US HOPE THAT IT SORT OF RETREATS THAT WE HAVE VOLUNTARY INTERNET SOLUTIONS INSTEAD.  OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOT CONSENSUS ON THAT ISSUE.  BUT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS CONSENSUS ON WANTING GOVERNMENT TO DESIST IN PARTICULAR THINGS.  I'M WONDERING, HOW CAN WE GET THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP DROPPING BOMBS ON BROWN PEOPLE ON THE THINGS SIDE OF THE WORLD AND STOP IMPRISONING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THROUGH CODE OF AMERICA OR OTHERWISE TO GET THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP DOING THINGS WE WANT IT NOT TO DO?
[ NOT AUDIBLE ]
SO, I MEAN, THIS MIGHT BE A ROUND ABOUT ANSWER.  WE DON'T WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR MANY REASONS POSTALLY BECAUSE FOR US -- MOST LEE WE THINK TO REBUILD CITIZENS AND GOVERNMENT AT THE PLACE WHERE CITIZENS INTERACT WITH GOVERNMENT.  IF WE CAN RESTORE TRUST ON THOSE DAY-TO-DAY INTERACTIONS, WE THINK THAT LEVELS UP TO DEEPER POLITICAL AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT.  MY ROLE AT DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZING TO THINK ABOUT THE WAYS THAT WE ENGAGE CITIZENS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BUILDING TECHNOLOGY, I PROMISE YOU IF YOU DO THIS STUFF YOU END UP FEELING REALLY EMPOWERED GOING TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN LOCAL ISSUES THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE.  THAT LADDERS UP TO MORE CIVIC AND POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT.  WHEN CITIZENS DON'T FEEL DISENGAGED WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING, THEN GOVERNMENT MAKES DECISIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT CITIZENS THINK.  WHEN CITIZENS FEEL EMPOWERED THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS.  WE THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO SHOW THAT THEM THEIR VOICE MATTERS OF WHAT THEY CAN DO IS GOING -- IS GOING TO WORK WHETHER THEY WANT TO -- WHATEVER THEIR POLITICAL ISSUE IS, POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW, THAT SHOWING THEM THAT THE DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR INVESTMENT OF TIME IN CIVICS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.  IT'S A RATIONAL DECISION AT THIS POINT NOT TO VOTE.  IF WE CAN CHANGE THAT CALCULUS I THINK WE WILL CHANGE -- SEE OUTCOMES THAT MORE DEMOCRATIC IF NOT GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.
[APPLAUSE]
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TALK.  THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE DATABASE UPTIME.  WE CAN SOLVE THINGS WITH TECHNOLOGY.  EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM CAN SOLVE REALLY HARD PROBLEMS WITH TECHNOLOGY.  BUT IT'S SOLVING THE BUREAUCRATIC PROBLEM WHICH IS PERHAPS A FUNDAMENTALLY HUMAN PROBLEM, NOT A TECHNICAL PROBLEM.  WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS HOW TO GET AROUND BUREAUCRACY, HOW TO SOLVE IT, HOW TO BREAK IT DOWN.
>> I'LL SAY THAT'S WHAT WE DO.  THE -- CODE FOR AMERICA'S THEORY OF CHANGE IS THAT BY BUILDING A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY LIKE BALANCE, WHICH IS SUPER EASY AND SIMPLE TO BUILD, CRYSTALLIZES THE PROBLEM.  FOR DECISION MAKERS.  WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN TIME AND AGAIN THAT ONCE YOU START HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW BROKEN THAT PART OF THE SYSTEM IS, THOSE CHANGES CAN FLOW UPSTREAM.  SO, IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE WORKED WITH THE HSA ON THE PROJECT THAT PRECEDED PROMPTLY THROUGH THAT PROJECT THEY REALIZED THAT ALL OF THEIR CITIZEN INTERACTIONS WERE REALLY POOR.  THEY HAD PEOPLE COMING IN TO THE HSA OFFICE HAVING TO TALK TO SOCIAL WORKERS OR CASE WORKERS BEHIND THREE INCHES OF BULLETPROOF GLASS THROUGH THESE CRAPPY MICROPHONES, THERE'S STORY OF ONE GUY WHO CAME IN HE COULDN'T BE HEARD THROUGH THE MICROPHONE HE HAD TO PHYSICALLY GET DOWN ON HIS KNEES IN ORDER TO BE HEARD JUST THE PERFECT METAPHOR FOR HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE.
AND DOING -- PEOPLE WHO WORK IN GOVERNMENT ARE GREAT PEOPLE.  THEY'RE CHAMPIONS THEY GOT INTO THIS WORK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP PEOPLE.  BUT THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE IS SET UP FOR THEM TO PLEASE, TO SERVE, TO THINK OF THEIR USER AS THE THINGS DEPARTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT NOT THE CITIZEN.  AND THROUGH BUILDING THESE TOOLS WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT PERSPECTIVE.  AND LADDERS UP TO A LOT GREATER CHANGE.  IF WE'RE NOT CHOOSING PROJECTS THAT WE THINKING PUSH CHANGE UPSTREAM TO POLICY MAKERS, THEN WE'RE NOT WORKING ON THE RIGHT PROJECTS.
>> THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
>> HI.  GREAT TALK, THANK YOU.  I RECOGNIZE THAT THE NAME IS CODE FOR AMERICA BUT I'D BE CURIOUS FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE WORLD OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AS A WHOLE WHICH INCLUDES TESTING, SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION, DESIGN, TECHNICAL WRITING, INTERNATIONAL -- LOCALIZATION FOR MULTIPLE LANGUAGES ALL THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY END UP GETTING INVOLVED, ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN HOW DESIGN AND USER EXPERIENCE THAT IS MAYBE COMPLETELY DIVORCED FROM CODE AND STUFF LIKE WIRE FRAMES ENDS UP IN THE CODE FOR AMERICA PROCESS.
>> YES, AGAIN, IT'S SORT OF CHEEKY NAME WE WERE PULLING, PLAY ON TEACH FOR AMERICA.  WE REALIZE THAT THE "CODE FOR" IS A LITTLE BIT MISLEADING AND CAN BE ALIENATING TO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO COME WORK WITH US.  BUT WE'RE KIND OF STUCK WITH IT NOW.  WE ALSO HAVE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT WE TEACH KIDS HOW TO CODE WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE AS WELL BECAUSE WE DON'T.  ALTHOUGH THAT'S REALLY GREAT THING TO DO.
BUT DESIGN AND UX ARE ESSENTIAL AS WRITING CODE.  I DON'T CODE.  I DIRECT OUR COMMUNITY'S TEAM THAT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO.  IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A COMMUNITY ORGANIZING FUNCTION, NONE OF THIS WORK WOULD REALLY MATTER WE'D BUILD A BUNCH OF TOOLS THAT STAYED IN THE ROOM.  HOW DO WE BUILD COMMUNITIES THAT ARE INCLUSIVE, WE CAN'T BUILD CIVIC TECHNOLOGY IF WE'RE NOT INCLUDING EVERYONE IN THE PROCESS.  IT DOESN'T WORK.  SORT OF THE DEFINITION OF CIVIC TECHNOLOGY.  HOW DO WE GET POPULATIONS TO THE TABLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE USING THESE TOOLS, WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THESE TOOLS, GET SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AT THE TABLE.  UX AND DESIGN IS CENTRAL.  WE HAVE WHOLE UX AND DESIGN SET OF STAFF PEOPLE ON STAFF.  WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE DESIGNER ON EVERY FELLOWSHIP TEAM.
ALL OF THAT STUFF IS REALLY IMPORTANT.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO CODE IN ORDER TO DO THIS WORK AND I WOULD GIVE ALMOST THE SAME PRESENTATION AT A ORGANIZING CONFERENCE AS I DID NOW.  BUT SINCE YOU GUYS ARE HERE, I PRESUME BECAUSE YOU ARE PROGRAMMERS WE NEED YOU AT THE TABLE AS WELL.
>> THANK YOU.
>> HI.  INSPIRING TALK, THANK YOU.
>> THANKS.
>> FOR THE THINGS PART OF THE CODE FOR AMERICA NAME.  THE AMERICA PART.  I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE WORLDWIDE?
>> YES.  AS I MENTIONED CODE FOR ALL, WHICH I FOUNDED SO I FEEL CLOSE AFFINITY TO.  WE'RE IN ABOUT 15 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, CANADA DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING YET, WE HEAR SOMETHING, BUT IF THERE ARE ANY CANADIANS THAT WANT TO START SOMETHING WE'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU.
BUT WE'RE IN AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, PAKISTAN, MEXICO, REALLY AROUND THE WORLD.  NETHERLANDS, FINLAND.  BUT WE'RE ALSO REALLY EXCITED FOR PEOPLE TO START NEW PROGRAMS WHERE THEY LIVE.  GOT TO COME FROM THE GRASS ROOTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEND PEOPLE FROM THE U.S. TO THINGS COUNTRIES TO DO THIS WORK.  SO IT'S BEEN DEMAND DRIVEN.  ANYONE OUT THERE FROM NON-AMERICA YOU WANT TO DO THIS WORK, YOU CAN GO TO THAT C4A.ME AND FIND A LINK.
>> THANK YOU.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> THANKS AND INSPIRING TALK.  JUST WONDERED IF SINCE -- IT'S GREAT TO KNOW THAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO ENGAGE IS NOW ACCEPTABLE IN THE PYTHON COMMUNITY.  AND I JUST WONDERED GIVEN THE PREVIOUS REMARKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY, SURELY TECHNOLOGY ENABLES AND INCREASINGLY FRACTAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE CITIZENRY AND THE GOVERNMENT AND ISN'T THE ANSWER REALLY FOR US ALL TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT OURSELVES.  AND THESE PROBLEMS WILL ONLY GO AWAY WHENEVER ONE CAN ACCEPT THAT AND EVERYONE CAN TAKE A FULL PART.
>> YES.  YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.
>> I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO DISAGREE WITH THAT.
>> YES.  PREACHING TO THE CHOIR.
>> HELLO.
>> HI.
>> A COUPLE YEARS BACK THERE WAS A GREAT LITTLE GAME THAT CAME OUT ONLINE IT WAS CALLED THE GERRYMANDERING GAME.  FIRST OF ALL I WONDER IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY PART IN IT?
IT WAS THIS GREAT LITTLE THING WHERE YOU HAD TO RESIZE AND MAKE THESE CRAZY BOUNDARIES IN VOTING DISTRICTS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW GERRYMANDERING IN THE STATES IS REALLY SCARY.  AND SECOND OF ALL I WONDER WHAT YOU SEE AS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GAMING AND GOVERNMENT IN EDUCATION.
>> SO, WE DID NOT HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THAT GAME BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.  IT WAS REALLY FUN.  AND DEPRESSING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, WE DON'T WORK ON POLITICS AT ALL.  WE WORK SPECIFICALLY ON THE BUREAUCRACY OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT IT'S -- WHILE THAT IS SUPER IMPORTANT AND WE ARE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THAT WORK, NO ONE'S REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE EVERY DAY FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT.  THE NON-POLITICAL PART.  AND THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY THINK THAT IF WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE THAT THAT BUBBLES UP.  THE SECOND PART -- GAMING.  WE DON'T HAVE INTENTIONAL FOCUS ON GAMING BUT LIKE I THINK WE BUILD IN GAME-AFIED ELEMENTS TO LIKE, CLICK THAT HOOD IS SUPER ADDICTIVE.  THE ADOPT A FRAMEWORK YOU CAN NAME YOUR HYDRANT THEN IF YOU DON'T CLEAN IT OUT THEN SOMEONE CAN STEAL IT FROM YOU.  WE BUILD IN SOME GAME ELEMENTS TO A LOT OF THE STUFF.  YEAH, IT'S IMPORTANT.  BUT WE DON'T HAVE A GAMING EXPERT ON STAFF AS WE DO LIKE UX AND DESIGN.
>> FAIR ENOUGH, THANKS SO MUCH.
>> IF YOU'RE A GAMER WANT TO JOIN YOUR LOCAL BRIGADE AND JOIN PROJECTS LIKE THAT, IT WOULD BE WELCOME.
>> GOOD TO KNOW.
>> I'M FROM MINNEAPOLIS, WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT-- GRASS ROOTS FROM THE BOTTOM UP WHICH I APPRECIATE.  ALSO, MY MAYOR RECENTLY WENT OUT TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND MET WITH QUITE A FEW THINGS MAYORS THERE SEEMS TO BE A LARGER TECHNOLOGICAL PUSH FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL DOWN TO THE REGIONAL AND CITY LEVEL.  COULD YOU TALK ANY MORE ABOUT HOW CODE FOR AMERICA MIGHT BE INTERACTING WITH THAT OR ARE YOU GUYS DOING ANYTHING MORE REGIONABLY APPLICABLE?
>> WE DON'T WORK ON FEDERAL PROJECTS.  BUT WE DO HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO OUR FOUNDER, JEN, SPENT A YEAR AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST YEAR.  SHE ACTUALLY SET UP THE NEW -- SHE WAS THERE WHEN HEALTH CARE.GOV HAPPENED WHICH IS A BLESSING AND AWFUL AS WELL.  KIND OF RUINED HER YEAR ALSO MADE HER YEAR.  BUT SHE SET UP IN RESPONSE TO THAT THE UNITED STATES DIGITAL SERVICE WHICH IS BASED ON THE U.K.'S GOVERNMENT DIGITAL SERVICE SO -- OUR SAFETY AND JUSTICE TEAM WAS JUST AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS PAST WEEK TALKING WITH POLICE CHIEFS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON POLICE INCIDENT DATA HOW TO GET -- CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THAT.  WE DO TRY TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY HAVE A LEVER THAT CAN BE PUSHED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  BUT WE REALLY FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL POINT OF IMPLEMENTATION.  AT THE POINT OF POLICY MAKING.
>> ENTIRELY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  IS THAT IT?
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANKS YOU GUYS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
