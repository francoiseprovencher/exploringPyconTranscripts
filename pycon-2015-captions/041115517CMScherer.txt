                041115517CMSCHERER
10:30:00AM      >> HELLO, EVERYONE.
10:30:01AM      SO OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MICHAEL SCHERER, AND HIS
10:30:04AM      TALK IS TITLED ANSIBLE.
10:30:13AM      [APPLAUSE]
10:30:17AM      >> GOOD MORNING.
10:30:20AM      I'M A SPEAKER, I AM SPEAK ABOUT MYSELF.
10:30:23AM      MY NAME IS MICHAEL, I'M LIVING IN PARIS AND
10:30:27AM      CURRENTLY WORKING AT -- WHICH IS OPEN SOURCE.
10:30:33AM      SO BASICALLY I'M TRAVELING WHEN THERE'S A PROJECT
10:30:36AM      FOR A COMPANY -- FOR A PROGRAM THEY CALL ME.
10:30:40AM      WE NEED TO REGISTER FOR WHERE WE WANT TO DEPLOY FOR
10:30:43AM      TWO WEEKS AND WHEN WE SEE TWO WEEKS WE MEAN TWO
10:30:48AM      MORE, AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT MOSTLY WITH
10:30:53AM      ANSIBLE SO THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO SPEAK ABOUT IT.
10:30:57AM      JUST QUICKLY, DOES EVERYBODY KNOW WHICH IS -- WHICH
10:31:01AM      IS ANSIBLE AND EVERYTHING?
10:31:03AM      I HOPE SO.
10:31:04AM      OKAY.
10:31:04AM      SO IT WILL BE QUICK.
10:31:06AM      JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS, BECAUSE YOU
10:31:08AM      KNOW THAT SOMEBODY -- SOME PEOPLE WILL JUST NOT
10:31:11AM      REACT.
10:31:12AM      SO ANSIBLE IS A TOOL WITHIN PYTHON -- IN PYTHON, TO
10:31:20AM      DEPLOY AND ORCHESTRATE ANY KIND OF TASK.
10:31:24AM      SO FOR US, WE NEED TO HAVE A LIST OF OUR SYSTEM.
10:31:28AM      OR THE SYSTEM YOU WANT TO MODIFY.
10:31:30AM      AND THEN YOU WILL PLAY YOUR PLAYBOOK, WHICH IS
10:31:38AM      SIMPLY, KIND OF A LIST OF COMMAND TO EXECUTE, SO
10:31:42AM      IT'S LIKE --
10:31:44AM      EACH COMMAND, IT'S USING MODEL.
10:31:49AM      FOR EXAMPLE, ONE MODEL TO INSERT, AND MAKE SURE YOU
10:31:53AM      INSERT TO STAT SERVICES, TO CREATE COMPLETE FILE
10:31:56AM      AND EVERYTHING.
10:31:57AM      SO YOU WANT SOMETHING SPECIAL, IT'S LIKELY ALREADY
10:32:01AM      DEVELOPED.
10:32:02AM      SO FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A TYPE OF COMMANDS THAT
10:32:06AM      YOU WILL RUN.
10:32:07AM      AND I WOULD USE THAT AS A CREATION TO SHOW YOU OR
10:32:10AM      WE CAN EXTEND EVERYTHING.
10:32:12AM      SO IT'S ALL ABOUT EXTENSION FOR ANSIBLE.
10:32:17AM      SO FIRST PART IS, I SAID, THE MOST COMMON USE IS
10:32:21AM      USING PLAYBOOK, BUT IN PRACTICE, YOU HAVE -- SO
10:32:26AM      FIRST ONE IS USING USAGE, WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE,
10:32:31AM      BECAUSE WHEN I USED TO BE WALKING IN OPPOSITION, I
10:32:36AM      DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS, SO I DECIDED, OKAY, YOU DO NOT
10:32:39AM      WANT TO GIVE ME ACCESS, THEN I WILL TAKE IT, AND I
10:32:42AM      STARTED TO USE ANSIBLE LIKE THIS.
10:32:44AM      SO THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO WITHOUT ANY KIND OF
10:32:47AM      INFRASTRUCTURE.
10:32:49AM      OR BASH BECAUSE --
10:32:54AM      SO THAT'S THE PART MOST PEOPLE WILL ALREADY KNOW,
10:32:57AM      WHICH IS NOT THAT INTERESTING.
10:33:00AM      AND THERE IS A PART ABOUT USING EVERYTHING IN A
10:33:02AM      PYTHON SCRIPT, WHICH IS QUITE NICE.
10:33:05AM      BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO DO, WHICH IS TO USE
10:33:11AM      A SINGLE INTERNAL OBJECT, A RUNNER, AND GIVE
10:33:16AM      EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO.
10:33:17AM      SO FOR EXAMPLE, I WILL BE ABLE TO WRITE EVERYTHING
10:33:21AM      ON THE SERVER.
10:33:24AM      AND THAT'S IT.
10:33:25AM      SO IF PEOPLE --
10:33:31AM      IT'S QUITE NICE YOU CAN USE PYTHON INSTEAD OF YAML,
10:33:36AM      BUT IT'S QUITE -- IT'S NOT -- YOU CANNOT DO MUCH.
10:33:41AM      THAT'S WHAT THE TOOL IS DOING.
10:33:44AM      WHAT'S INTERESTING TO EXTEND, SO IN THIS CASE, I
10:33:49AM      EXPLAINED THAT YOU HAVE A LIST OF SERVICES -- OF A
10:33:52AM      SERVER.
10:33:53AM      OH.
10:33:53AM      SO IT CAN BE A LIST OF -- IT'S A FILE.
10:33:57AM      LIKE THIS.
10:33:57AM      SO YOU CAN HAVE WWW.EXAMPLE.ORG.
10:34:03AM      WHICH IS QUITE SPECIAL BECAUSE YOU CAN SPECIFY WHAT
10:34:08AM      KIND OF PART YOU WANT.
10:34:10AM      FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW GARRET, IT'S -- SO WHICH
10:34:20AM      --
10:34:21AM      SO FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT YOU CAN DO IS MAKE INVENTORY.
10:34:26AM      THAT'S QUITE EASY.
10:34:29AM      DEVELOP A SCRIPT AND IT CAN BE ANYTHING.
10:34:31AM      OF COURSE IT WILL BE PYTHON, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE
10:34:33AM      ARE PYTHON.
10:34:34AM      BUT IT CAN BE BASH, IT CAN BE...
10:34:39AM      AND THE ONLY THING IT NEEDS TO DO IS...
10:34:46AM      AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO ADD META DATA.
10:34:53AM      A USER, OR PASSWORD.
10:34:55AM      FOR EXAMPLE, ALSO YOU CAN DO, BACK IN MY PREVIOUS
10:34:58AM      POSITION, I HAD TO CONNECT TO A NET TOP SERVER.
10:35:03AM      USING --
10:35:06AM      [NO AUDIO]
10:35:11AM      AND I HAD TO SCRIPT THAT GOES THERE.
10:35:13AM      ENTER PASSWORD.
10:35:14AM      CONNECT TO THE FIRST ONE, AND EVERYTHING.
10:35:17AM      AND USING ANSIBLE DATA INVENTORY, I WAS -- I WAS
10:35:22AM      ABLE TO WRITE EVERYTHING.
10:35:24AM      YOU CAN USE A SERVER IF YOU ARE USING PEPET, AND
10:35:31AM      LIKE ME YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS.
10:35:33AM      YOU CAN LIST THE SERVICE FROM WHERE -- FROM YOUR
10:35:36AM      CLOUD PROVIDER, EVEN IF IT'S NOT YOUR FAVORITE ONE.
10:35:39AM      I MEAN, WE DO NOT CARE.
10:35:41AM      AND JUST KIND OF SCRIPT IS READY, CONFIGURED BY
10:35:45AM      ENVIRONMENT.
10:35:45AM      LIKE YOU ARE USING IPI KEY IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND
10:35:52AM      YOU ARE DUMPING ALL YOUR VALUABLE.
10:35:59AM      CONSIDERING YOU DO NOT LIKE IT --
10:36:03AM      SO THERE IS THAT -- THAT'S ONE WAY WHERE YOU CAN
10:36:06AM      EXTEND AND MAKE SURE ANSIBLE IS WORKING WITH DATA
10:36:12AM      STRUCTURE.
10:36:14AM      AND YOU CAN DO MORE THAN ASAGE.
10:36:21AM      YOU CAN CONNECT, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH SHARED -- SO YOU
10:36:27AM      CAN PREPARE A SYSTEM WITH ANSIBLE.
10:36:30AM      IT'S ABLE TO DO THAT.
10:36:36AM      YOU CAN SEE TRENDS AND YOU HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT --
10:36:39AM      [NO AUDIO]
10:36:46AM      IT'S DONE BY THE SAME PEOPLE.
10:36:48AM      SO THEY WERE QUITE HELPFUL WHEN I HAD THE
10:36:52AM      CONNECTOR, SO YOU CAN USE ANSIBLE.
10:36:59AM      IN PRACTICE, I NEED TO FIX A BUG, THAT'S THE KIND
10:37:02AM      OF STUFF YOU WANT.
10:37:03AM      YOU CAN CONNECT WITH J, WITH ANYTHING.
10:37:09AM      [NO AUDIO]
10:37:11AM      YOU JUST NEED TO CREATE A MODEL.
10:37:13AM      I'M USING THE PASS FOR --
10:37:17AM      WITH --
10:37:18AM      [NO AUDIO]
10:37:23AM      IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.
10:37:25AM      NEED TO IMPLEMENT CONNECTION CLASS.
10:37:28AM      WITH THE NAME OF THE MATTER.
10:37:30AM      AND THEN YOU BASICALLY --
10:37:35AM      THIS IS PYTHON, EVERYTHING IS CLOSED.
10:37:38AM      AND, TECHNICALLY, YOU CAN JUST CREATE A FILE USING
10:37:43AM      EXEC COMMAND.
10:37:45AM      AND THAT'S IT.
10:37:49AM      [NO AUDIO]
10:37:58AM      THAT'S FOR EXTENSION.
10:37:59AM      BUT WHERE YOU CAN GO BEYOND IS THROUGH YAML FILE.
10:38:03AM      AND SO I QUICKLY SPOKE ON PLAYBOOK, EXPECTING
10:38:06AM      EVERYBODY TO KNOW, BUT -- SO PLAYBOOK IS BASICALLY
10:38:10AM      SOMETHING YAML.
10:38:13AM      IT'S DOMAIN-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE BASED ON YAML.
10:38:17AM      WHICH IS QUITE NICE.
10:38:18AM      BECAUSE YOU CAN USE IT TO ANALYZE THE SCRIPT.
10:38:21AM      SO YOU CAN DO ALL KIND OF INTERESTING STUFF WITH
10:38:23AM      THAT.
10:38:25AM      EXCEPT THAT SINCE YOU CANNOT DO EVERYTHING IN YAML,
10:38:32AM      ADD A GINGER, WHICH IS WORD LANGUAGE FROM PYTHON,
10:38:38AM      AMONG 1,000 OTHERS.
10:38:39AM      SO FOR EXAMPLE, TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,
10:38:46AM      THERE IS ONE SIMPLE PLAYBOOK THAT WILL INSTALL.
10:38:50AM      THERE'S A PACKAGE, IT'S A VARIABLE USED FOR A LINE.
10:38:59AM      AND SO I NEED TO CHANGE --
10:39:07AM      SO SINCE IT'S IN GINGER, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU
10:39:12AM      WANT.
10:39:12AM      LIKE ADDING A GINGER EXTENSION.
10:39:15AM      WHICH IS A SIMPLE PYTHON FUNCTION.
10:39:19AM      YOU CAN ADD A GINGER FUNCTION AND TAG.
10:39:25AM      AGAIN, REFER TO THE GINGER DOCUMENTATION ABOUT
10:39:28AM      THIS.
10:39:33AM      GINGER TWO EXTENSION.
10:39:35AM      IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT DOES, DO NOT TOUCH IT.
10:39:39AM      I DON'T KNOW, SO I DON'T TOUCH IT.
10:39:41AM      I DON'T SPEAK ABOUT IT.
10:39:42AM      CREATING SPECIFIC TAGS SO YOU CAN DELEGATE COMPLETE
10:39:47AM      FILE TO ALL THE PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE...
10:39:55AM      SO I SAID THAT THIS IS --
10:40:00AM      YOU STILL NEED FROM, TIME TO TIME, CONFIG
10:40:04AM      STRUCTURE.
10:40:05AM      LIKE, THIS IS A LOOP, TO INSTALL APACHE, SO THIS IS
10:40:11AM      A LOOP.
10:40:13AM      WHICH IS NICE.
10:40:15AM      IS THAT THE LOOP BY THEMSELVES CAN BE DONE WITH A
10:40:19AM      PLUGIN.
10:40:20AM      SO YOU HAVE A PLUGIN FOR LOOPS.
10:40:24AM      THIS IS NOT CALLED A LOOP PLUGINS.
10:40:35AM      IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO FURTHER, OR IN TWO
10:40:39AM      DAYS, FEEL FREE.
10:40:42AM      SO THIS IS -- THIS IS CALLED -- THIS IS -- WAIT.
10:40:46AM      THIS IS IMPLEMENTED USING A FUNCTION LOOK UP.
10:40:50AM      WHICH IS REALLY USEABLE IN GINGER.
10:40:52AM      FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO PART, THE
10:40:55AM      FIRST ONE IS LOOKING AT UNVARIABLE FROM AN
10:40:59AM      ENVIRONMENT.
10:40:59AM      AND THIS ONE IS USING THE SAME CODE, BUT CHOOSING
10:41:03AM      DIFFERENT NOTATION, AND IT SHOULD RESULT IN THE
10:41:06AM      SAME OUTPUT, TECHNICALLY THE SAME, BUT GOOD ENOUGH
10:41:10AM      FOR MY PRESENTATION.
10:41:11AM      SO IF YOU WANT TO ADD YOUR OWN LOOK UP FOR WHATEVER
10:41:16AM      YOU WANT, OR YOU CAN USE IT AS A LOOP.
10:41:20AM      SO FOR EXAMPLE, THE CODE IS THERE.
10:41:22AM      IT'S FIVE LINE OF CODE.
10:41:24AM      AND FOUR LINE OF BOILERPLATES AND 20 LINE OF
10:41:28AM      LICENSE.
10:41:31AM      SO YOU CAN INSTRUCT SPECIFIC -- YOU CAN EXTRACT
10:41:34AM      SPECIFIC DATA.
10:41:35AM      FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN EXTRACT PASSWORD.
10:41:39AM      WHICH IS NICE BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVER NEED TO
10:41:42AM      COMMUNICATE.
10:41:42AM      SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO HAVE SAME PASSWORD.
10:41:47AM      AND IF IT NEVER LEAVES -- IF IT NEVER LEAVES THE
10:41:51AM      SERVER, IT'S BETTER.
10:41:52AM      NO LEAK.
10:41:52AM      NO ANYTHING.
10:41:53AM      AND YOU CAN JUST REMOVE IT AND CHANGE IT --
10:41:56AM      [NO AUDIO]
10:42:00AM      IF YOU ARE A BIG COMPANY, OR YOU HAVE A PROPER
10:42:04AM      POWER AND EVERYTHING AND DATABASE, STRONG DATABASE,
10:42:09AM      YOU KNOW, WHEN --
10:42:14AM      IT'S BETTER TO HAVE MULTIPLE COPY.
10:42:17AM      HAVING DIFFERENT INFORMATION IN DIFFERENT DATABASE.
10:42:20AM      SO, AGAIN, IT'S QUITE EASY.
10:42:22AM      YOU NEED TO CREATE A PYTHON MODULE.
10:42:24AM      MOST OF THE TIME THIS IS ALWAYS STARTING BY PYTHON
10:42:27AM      MODULE.
10:42:28AM      CREATE A --
10:42:32AM      [AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
10:42:37AM      AND QR DOCUMENTS.
10:42:38AM      AND YOU JUST RETURN THE DATA.
10:42:44AM      IT'S -- YOU CAN CHECK THE CODE, FOR EXAMPLE, AGAIN,
10:42:49AM      THESE ARE VERY SIMPLE ONE, WITH FIVE LINES OF
10:42:52AM      INTERESTING CODE, LIKE, ENVIRONMENT PLUGIN, WHICH
10:43:00AM      IS JUST ONE LINE, AND GIVING --
10:43:03AM      AND ONE WAY TO EXTEND ANSIBLE IS JUST TO USE YOUR
10:43:11AM      OWN ANSIBLE MODULE.
10:43:12AM      SO WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING IN SHARE IS BETTER TO DO
10:43:15AM      IT IN PYTHON.
10:43:16AM      I DO NOT NEED TO GO INTO THAT.
10:43:18AM      IT'S EASIER BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN HAVE A PROPER
10:43:22AM      WRITTEN CODE AND INFORMATION AND EVERYTHING.
10:43:26AM      LIKE PYTHON, IT'S INCLUDED.
10:43:30AM      SO YOU HAVE LOTS AND LOTS.
10:43:34AM      ONE NAME -- SO FOR PEOPLE USING, YOU WILL NOT BE
10:43:41AM      SURPRISED, THIS WAS DONE BY YOUR X -- PEOPLE.
10:43:45AM      AND ANSIBLE IS A PYTHON SCRIPT.
10:43:49AM      OBVIOUSLY.
10:43:50AM      DOCUMENTATION GOING CALLED DOCUMENTATION, WHICH IS
10:43:53AM      USED ON THE WEBSITE, AND SOME COMMAND LINE TO SHOW
10:43:58AM      EVERYTHING.
10:44:01AM      AND ITS FUNCTION, MAIN, THE REASON ANSIBLE MODEL
10:44:08AM      YOU NEED TO -- WITH DOCUMENT SPECIFICATION, SO YOU
10:44:14AM      CAN SEE WHICH IS MANDATORY, WHICH IS NOT MANDATORY.
10:44:17AM      YOU CAN HAVE A COMPLEX SYSTEM WITH INCAPABILITY.
10:44:22AM      IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT, THERE IS A DIGITAL,
10:44:27AM      I PREFER TO HAVE A MODEL, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, NOT
10:44:30AM      EVERYBODY LISTEN TO ME, SO SOME PEOPLE DO VERY
10:44:35AM      COMPLEX MODEL WITH THIS KIND OF PERIMETER.
10:44:38AM      AND THEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ANSIBLE USING A
10:44:40AM      MODULE EXGISM.
10:44:44AM      FAIL WHEN YOU FAIL AND EXIT WHEN YOU DO NOT FAIL.
10:44:48AM      SO THAT'S QUITE OBVIOUS.
10:44:50AM      YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF, WHICH IS IT NEEDS TO BE
10:44:54AM      CURTAIN WITH THE PYTHON.
10:44:55AM      SO FOR --
10:45:00AM      SOME ANSIBLE CUSTOMER ARE USING WEB FIDE.
10:45:03AM      I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE CHECKING THAT QUITE -- THEY
10:45:07AM      DO NOT CHECK THAT MUCH, BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO IN
10:45:13AM      CUL, I THINK THAT'S FINE.
10:45:15AM      BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANSIBLE, IT
10:45:18AM      NEEDS TO BE PYTHON, OR YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL THEY
10:45:22AM      DECIDE TO STOP FOR WEB FIDE.
10:45:27AM      MAYBE IN TEN YEARS.
10:45:28AM      SO SORRY.
10:45:32AM      EXIT REMOTELY.
10:45:33AM      YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IT SEND TO A SYSTEM, PYTHON.
10:45:37AM      YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIST IS DONE, SO YOU
10:45:40AM      DO NOT NEED TO STOP -- SIO OR --
10:45:47AM      IF POSSIBLE, USE STANDARD STUFF.
10:45:55AM      [AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
10:45:59AM      BECAUSE THIS LINE IS, THERE WAS A SEARCH AND
10:46:01AM      REPLACE FOR THE WORD FOR THE MODULE, SO IT BE RUN
10:46:07AM      USING ONE SINGLE FILE.
10:46:09AM      SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS ISSUE CHANGED, LIKE ADD
10:46:12AM      ONE MORE SPACE OR JUST REMOVE, OR WHATEVER.
10:46:15AM      IT WILL NOT WORK.
10:46:16AM      IT WILL COMPLAIN.
10:46:18AM      THEN IF YOU WANT TO TEST, WHICH IS ONE SCRIPT.
10:46:24AM      WHICH IS A TEST MODULE.
10:46:29AM      WHEN I DID FIRST PRESENTATION, I NEED TO SHOW THEY
10:46:33AM      ARE LISTENING TO ME AND DOING THEIR PROPER
10:46:36AM      DOCUMENTATION AND EVERYTHING.
10:46:38AM      SO THIS IS A SCRIPT, YOU CAN USE, FIGURE OUT,
10:46:42AM      SCRIPTING TEST.
10:46:47AM      THAT WAS OUR FIRST SESSION TODAY ABOUT THIS.
10:46:49AM      SO TODAY -- SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT DO REAL LIVE
10:46:52AM      TESTING.
10:46:53AM      IF YOU NEED 1,000 VM AND MAYBE IT'S QUITE
10:46:57AM      EXPENSIVE.
10:46:59AM      I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE USING MOCK TESTING.
10:47:05AM      IT RUNS EVERY MONTH LIKE THIS.
10:47:07AM      SOMETIMES, WHATEVER -- IF YOU WANT TO GO BEYOND,
10:47:09AM      LIKE, YOU WANT TO EXECUTE SOMETHING REMOTELY, WANT
10:47:12AM      TO EXECUTE ON MY LAPTOP, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
10:47:16AM      AND THANKS FOR ASKING IT, BECAUSE THERE WAS AN
10:47:19AM      ACTION PLUGIN.
10:47:22AM      ON THE CLIENT SIDE, SO FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU WANT
10:47:25AM      TO COMPUTE SOMETHING, WHERE YOU NEED TO EXECUTE IT,
10:47:28AM      FROM THE SYSTEM, JUST TO OPEN THE FILE, OR IF YOU
10:47:31AM      WANT TO DO SOME COMPUTING, AGAIN, DONE ON THE
10:47:36AM      CLIENT SIDE.
10:47:37AM      SO, AGAIN, THIS IS A PYTHON MODEL.
10:47:42AM      AGAIN, YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC OR CLASS TO IMPLEMENT.
10:47:46AM      AND, AGAIN, YOU HAVE A FUNCTION CALLED RUN.
10:47:51AM      AND YOU NEED TO RETURN THE WIZARD TO EXECUTION.
10:47:55AM      AS I SAID, THIS IS EXECUTED ON THE CLIENT SIDE.
10:47:58AM      IT'S NOT -- BECAUSE EVERYTHING INTERESTING I'VE
10:48:02AM      ALREADY DONE, BUT IF YOU HAVE AN ID, YOU CAN DO IT.
10:48:05AM      THE ONLY PROBLEM, YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
10:48:08AM      ANSIBLE INTERNALS, LIKE TEN PARAMETERS, AND IT'S
10:48:15AM      DOCUMENTED IN THE CODE, BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH IPI
10:48:20AM      FOR THAT.
10:48:20AM      AND I DO NOT THINK IT'S TABLE YET.
10:48:23AM      BUT YOU CAN ASK THEM.
10:48:25AM      THEY HAVE A BOOTH IN THE EXPO.
10:48:27AM      SO, YEAH.
10:48:30AM      EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO, EXCEPT -- FINISH, AND RUN.
10:48:35AM      AND FOR THAT, WE HAVE A CALL BACK PLUGIN, WHICH IS
10:48:40AM      DOING EXECUTION.
10:48:41AM      WITH IT, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.
10:48:44AM      FOR EXAMPLE, LOOK FOR SOMETHING IN A FILE.
10:48:49AM      YOU CAN -- I KNOW YOUR COWORKER BY POSTING, OR
10:48:53AM      WHATEVER YOU ARE USING, STACK.
10:48:55AM      TESTING YOUR -- SENDING YOUR SMS, WHATEVER.
10:49:00AM      AGAIN MODEL.
10:49:04AM      AND AGAIN, YOU NEED TO FOLLOW SPECIFIC METHOD.
10:49:07AM      SO FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE OMITTED PLAYBOOK.
10:49:12AM      IT'S QUITE --
10:49:20AM      THERE IS ONE THAT YOU CAN COPY AND PASTE, AND YOU
10:49:24AM      CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.
10:49:25AM      THIS IS RUNNING --
10:49:33AM      SO I WENT FURTHER THAN I -- I WENT FASTER THAN I
10:49:38AM      EXPECTED.
10:49:38AM      SO I HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS.
10:49:43AM      YOU CAN EXTEND.
10:49:44AM      SINCE I THINK EVERYONE --
10:49:53AM      EACH TIME YOU CONNECT WITH SERVER, IT WILL GET --
10:49:57AM      IT GOES WHAT TYPE OF VERSION IT IS.
10:50:00AM      IS IT RUNNING.
10:50:02AM      IP ADDRESS AND EVERYTHING.
10:50:04AM      AND NOW WE CAN START THAT ON -- STORE THAT ON A
10:50:08AM      FILE.
10:50:09AM      I THINK IT'S ALREADY DATABASE.
10:50:11AM      SO MUCH STUFF WHERE YOU CAN PUT DATA.
10:50:14AM      SO YOU CAN PUT IT.
10:50:15AM      YOU JUST NEED TO WRITE TO MODEL.
10:50:18AM      NOT THIS ONE, BECAUSE I ALREADY DID.
10:50:20AM      BUT YOU CAN STORE THAT.
10:50:24AM      YOU JUST NEED TO WRITE A MODEL FOR THAT.
10:50:29AM      THERE IS A SHARE PLUGIN, WHICH IS SOMETHING I
10:50:32AM      DIDN'T LOOK AT.
10:50:34AM      MOSTLY USE TO MAKE ANSIBLE RUN, AND ON WINDOWS.
10:50:40AM      I DIDN'T LOOK, SO IT'S...
10:50:46AM      AND ALSO IS A PLUGIN FOR A VARIABLE, SO YOU CAN
10:50:49AM      DECIDE TO INJECT VARIABLE USING MORE THAN JUST YAML
10:50:54AM      FIDE.
10:50:55AM      AND I DON'T HAVE ANY USE FOR THAT, BUT IF YOU DO,
10:50:57AM      IT'S QUITE EASY.
10:50:59AM      SO THERE IS THIS KIND OF PLUGIN.
10:51:02AM      AND NEW VERSION OF ANSIBLE COMING, SO A DIFFERENT
10:51:08AM      VERSION, CURRENTLY 1.9.
10:51:10AM      AND THEY WANT TO REFACTOR EVERYTHING.
10:51:12AM      AND THERE IS --
10:51:16AM      [AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
10:51:19AM      AND FOR PEOPLE --
10:51:23AM      [AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
10:51:29AM      SOMEWHERE IN THE BUILDING, SO YOU CAN JUST...
10:51:32AM      [AUDIO CUTTING IN AND OUT]
10:51:39AM      START WITH THE WEB SERVER AND EVERYTHING.
10:51:42AM      AND CHANGE THE INTERFACE.
10:51:51AM      THEY'RE GOING TO REFACTOR, MAYBE SOME STUFF I SAID
10:51:54AM      INTERNAL WILL BE CHANGE.
10:51:56AM      AND SINCE THIS IS NOT DOCUMENTED, BUT I DO NOT WANT
10:52:03AM      TO BREAK TOO MUCH.
10:52:04AM      IF YOU ARE ALREADY WALKING, GO DISCUSS WITH THEM.
10:52:08AM      IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION, I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT
10:52:12AM      MOMENT.
10:52:14AM      AND IF YOU DON'T, YOU CAN JUST MAKE SOME UPLOADS
10:52:18AM      FOR ME FOR FIVE MINUTES.
10:52:20AM      IT'S GOOD FOR MY EGO.
10:52:24AM      [APPLAUSE]
10:52:34AM      >> SO WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS.
10:52:36AM      IF YOU GOT ONE, THERE'S A MICROPHONE RIGHT THERE.
10:52:57AM      >> AUDIENCE: YEAH, I ACTUALLY GOT ONE.
10:52:58AM      I AM CURRENTLY TRANSFERRING TO USING ANSIBLE FOR
10:53:01AM      SOME OF MY STUFF AT WORK.
10:53:03AM      AND I'M FINDING THAT I HAVE A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME
10:53:05AM      IF I HAVE JUST TWO LITTLE SHELF OF SCRIPTS THAT I
10:53:12AM      CAN SET IN ANSIBLE.
10:53:14AM      A LIST OF VARIABLES THERE'S NOT AN EASY WAY TO WRAP
10:53:17AM      TWO SCRIPTS.
10:53:18AM      IT DEPENDS ON A SPECIFIC MODULE.
10:53:20AM      IS THERE A WAY OF USING THE SAME VARIABLES WITHOUT
10:53:23AM      REPLAY THEM ON TWO MODULES IN A ROW?
10:53:31AM      >> I THINK THAT YOU CAN USE -- IT'S SHELL SCRIPT,
10:53:37AM      AND YOU WANT TO, IF I'M, YOU WANT TO SEND THEM AND
10:53:41AM      REUSE VARIABLE.
10:53:44AM      FOR THE SAME.
10:53:45AM      HMM.
10:53:46AM      THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
10:53:48AM      I WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE SEND SOME FILE AND WRITE
10:53:52AM      THEM AS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.
10:53:55AM      OR I WOULD JUST -- REWRITE EVERYTHING AS PYTHON AND
10:53:58AM      THEN I CAN USE THEM AS ANSIBLE VARIABLE.
10:54:01AM      >> AUDIENCE: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I DID.
10:54:03AM      OKAY.
10:54:04AM      >> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A WAY.
10:54:06AM      IF YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM, YOU CAN USE
10:54:09AM      -- NO.
10:54:10AM      I DON'T THINK THERE IS A WAY.
10:54:12AM      >> AUDIENCE: THANKS.
10:54:23AM      >> QUESTION?
10:54:29AM      I CAN'T ANSWER EVERYTHING, BUT AT LEAST I CAN TRY.
10:54:35AM      OKAY.
10:54:38AM      >> AUDIENCE: YEAH, I'M USING ANSIBLE, TOO.
10:54:40AM      AND I WANT -- I'M TEST TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT.
10:54:45AM      IS THERE ANY WAY TO TEST PLAYBOOK?
10:54:51AM      >> TO WHAT?
10:54:52AM      >> AUDIENCE: I WANT TO TEST.
10:54:57AM      IS THERE ANY WAY TO TEST MAKING --
10:55:04AM      >> YOU ARE USING TAGS AND YOU WANT TO TEST TAGS
10:55:08AM      ACTIVATED, YOU DO NOT GO WITH JUST STUFF LIKE
10:55:11AM      CREATING VM.
10:55:13AM      AND YOU JUST DO THAT.
10:55:15AM      YOU CAN JUST CHANGE THE -- WHAT I DO IS I RUN
10:55:21AM      EVERYTHING IN TRAY VS, AND MAKE SURE I USE
10:55:27AM      NON-DIRECT CHANGE BECAUSE I PREFER TO MAKE SURE
10:55:29AM      THAT MY AUTOMATION DO NOT DESTROY EVERYTHING.
10:55:37AM      AND WHAT YOU CAN DO, JUST DECIDE TO USE A DIFFERENT
10:55:40AM      INVENTORY OR SET OF SERVER.
10:55:43AM      SO WAIT FOR YOUR TEST TO RUN ON A SPECIFIC OPEN
10:55:47AM      CLOUD OR WORK SPACE OR WHATEVER, AND YOU DO NOT
10:55:49AM      TOUCH PRODUCTION.
10:55:52AM      AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS MORE THAN THIS.
10:55:56AM      I DO HAVE YAMLI WHICH IS TESTING EVERYTHING.
10:56:01AM      BUT --
10:56:04AM      YOU CAN DO THAT IN VM OR THIS KIND OF STUFF.
10:56:08AM      BESIDES THAT, NO, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC MAGIC FOR
10:56:11AM      TESTING.
10:56:12AM      YOU JUST NEED TO GIVE IT TEST VM.
10:56:15AM      PEOPLE LOOKING AT SEVERAL SPEC.
10:56:49AM      >> OKAY.
10:56:49AM      SO THANKS FOR LISTENING.
10:56:51AM      [APPLAUSE]
