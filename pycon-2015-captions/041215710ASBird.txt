00:14:56:07  >> WELCOME TO THE LAST SESSION.
00:23:34:10  WE HAVE THREE EXCELLENT TALKS.
00:23:36:13  YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU STUCK
00:23:37:25  AROUND.
00:23:38:07  OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS SARAH BIRD
00:23:40:25  WHO WILL TELL US ONCE AND FOR
00:23:42:22  ALL WHETHER IT'S BO-KA OR
00:23:48:19  BO-KAY.
00:23:52:13  [ Applause ]
00:23:54:13  >> HI, EVERYBODY.
00:23:55:13  MY NAME IS SARAH BIRD.
00:23:57:04  I WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED
00:24:00:01  APTIVATE.
00:24:01:28  AND TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING
00:24:03:16  ABOUT INTERACTIVE DATA FOR THE
00:24:06:07  WEB IN PYTHON USING THE DATA
00:24:08:25  VISUALIZATION LIBRARY BOKEH.
00:24:11:19  I JUST PRONOUNCE IT WITH MY
00:24:14:13  BRITISH ACCENT AND PEOPLE SAY IT
00:24:16:13  SOUNDS CHARMING.
00:24:18:04  AND SO I'M THE KIND OF PERSON
00:24:19:28  THAT LIKES TO LEARN THINGS BY
00:24:24:01  DOING, SLASH, BREAKING THEM, SO
00:24:26:25  WE'RE GONNA GET A FEEL FOR THE
00:24:30:01  CAPABILITIES.
00:24:31:16  IT'S A DATA VISUALIZATION
00:24:33:07  LIBRARY.
00:24:33:25  THERE ARE MANY DATA
00:24:35:25  VISUALIZATION LIBRARIES ALREADY.
00:24:36:28  IT'S TYPICALLY A STRONG HOLD OF
00:24:38:28  JAVASCRIPT WORLD, BUT IN THE
00:24:42:01  PYTHON WORLD WE HAVE THINGS LIKE
00:24:43:19  MAP PLOT LIB AND OTHER THINGS
00:24:47:04  LIKE THAT.
00:24:47:28  BUT BOKEH IS DIFFERENT.
00:24:50:01  BOKEH IS IN PYTHON.
00:24:52:01  IT MAKES YOUR VISUALIZATIONS FOR
00:24:55:07  THE WEB AS WEBBY OBJECTS THAT
00:24:57:16  ARE INTERACTIVE AND DYNAMIC AND
00:25:02:07  REALLY DATA DRIVEN AND ITS ROOTS
00:25:04:25  AND ITS HISTORY IS IN DATA
00:25:07:10  SCIENCE AND SO HOW MANY PEOPLE
00:25:09:28  HERE WOULD SORT OF PULL
00:25:11:19  THEMSELVES IN THE DATA SCIENTIST
00:25:13:25  CAMP?
00:25:14:13  SO A FEW PEOPLE HERE, PANDA, AND
00:25:17:13  NOTEBOOK, THEY'RE GONNA BE
00:25:19:07  NODDING.
00:25:20:01  HOW MANY PEOPLE ON THE WEB
00:25:21:13  DEVELOPER SIDE OF THINGS?
00:25:22:19  RIGHT.
00:25:23:01  SO THESE THINGS MEAN NOTHING TO
00:25:25:04  US.
00:25:25:16  BUT THAT'S A BIT OF A FOREIGN
00:25:27:19  WORLD, BUT I THINK BOKEH IS A
00:25:29:16  REALLY POWERFUL TOOL FOR ME AS A
00:25:32:22  DJANGO DEVELOPER.
00:25:33:25  AND SO WHENEVER I CAN, I LIKE TO
00:25:36:25  STAY IN PYTHON.
00:25:38:10  THAT IS MY FIRST REASON FOR
00:25:39:22  LOVING BOKEH IS I REALLY LIKE
00:25:42:01  WRITING IN PYTHON, AND I THINK
00:25:43:16  THIS IS A CROWD THAT PROBABLY
00:25:46:01  ALSO LIKING WRITING IN PYTHON.
00:25:47:25  YOU GET TO STAY JUST IN THAT
00:25:49:28  WORLD, BUT YOU'RE STILL MAKING A
00:25:52:28  DIFFERENT END INTERACTIVE
00:25:55:13  VISUALIZATIONS.
00:25:56:01  THERE ARE OTHER REASONS TO USE
00:25:57:10  BOKEH TOO.
00:25:57:28  THE FIRST ONE IS IF ANY OF YOU
00:26:00:13  HAVE EVER USED SOMETHING LIKE
00:26:03:13  D3.JS, THERE IS A LIMIT TO HOW
00:26:05:22  MANY NUMBER -- HOW MANY NUMBER
00:26:07:04  OF ELEMENTS YOU CAN ACTUALLY
00:26:08:19  THROUGH AT THE DOME BEFORE YOUR
00:26:10:16  BROWSER EXPLODES.
00:26:11:22  BOKEH USES CANVAS TO RENDER YOUR
00:26:16:01  VISUALIZATIONS, AND IT'S NOT
00:26:17:22  GONNA COMPLAIN.
00:26:19:22  THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON SOME
00:26:22:01  WEB G.L. BACK IN 2 WHICH IS
00:26:24:22  GONNA MAKE THAT EVEN BETTER.
00:26:26:01  AND WITH BOKEH CONNECTED TO THE
00:26:27:28  SERVER SIDE, YOU CAN REALLY DO
00:26:29:13  SOME AWESOME THINGS WITH BIG
00:26:31:01  DATA, WHICH THERE'S LOTS OF
00:26:32:22  INFORMATION ABOUT ONLINE, I'M
00:26:34:01  NOT GONNA TALK SO MUCH ABOUT
00:26:35:22  TODAY BUT I'M HAPPY TO TALK
00:26:37:07  ABOUT LATER.
00:26:39:10  BOKEH LET'S YOU DO REAL-TIME
00:26:42:07  UPDATES.
00:26:43:01  WHEN YOU CONNECT YOUR DATA
00:26:44:19  VISUALIZATION TO THE BOKEH
00:26:45:25  SERVER, ANY TIME YOUR DATA
00:26:47:16  CHANGES, THAT DATA'S GONNA BE
00:26:51:01  PUSHED STRAIGHT DOWN YOUR PLOT.
00:26:53:19  THE FOURTH THING THAT MAKES
00:26:55:16  BOKEH AWESOME IS YOU'RE TRYING
00:26:57:13  TO INTERACT WITH YOUR PLOT BUT
00:27:00:16  MAYBE DOING SOME COMPUTATION
00:27:03:01  THAT YOUR BROWSER'S GONNA REALLY
00:27:07:16  COMPLAIN ABOUT, THROW IT BACK
00:27:09:10  DOWN AND IT'S GONNA WORK REALLY
00:27:10:28  NICELY FOR YOU.
00:27:11:25  SO BOKEH IS NOT THE MAGIC SILVER
00:27:13:25  BULLET.
00:27:14:13  THERE NEVER IS ONE IN WEB.
00:27:17:07  BUT IT IS MY NEW DEFAULT.
00:27:19:10  IT'S MY NEW GO-TO TOOL TO WRITE
00:27:22:04  SOMETHING, AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
00:27:24:10  MAYBE YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON IF YOU
00:27:25:28  REALLY HAVE A SPECIALIZED NEED.
00:27:27:22  BUT BOKEH COVERED AN AWFUL LOT.
00:27:31:07  VERY QUICKLY, HOW DOES IT WORK,
00:27:32:28  BECAUSE WE'RE WRITING PYTHON,
00:27:34:25  BUT MAGICALLY JAVASCRIPT COMES
00:27:37:19  OUT.
00:27:38:01  YOU WRITE PYTHON ON THE SERVER
00:27:39:22  SIDE.
00:27:40:04  AND IT MAKES A JSON AND THAT
00:27:44:16  GETS SHOVED DOWN TO YOUR CLIENT.
00:27:47:10  AND THERE IS ACTUALLY A LIBRARY,
00:27:49:19  SO THE BOKEH CORE DEV TEAM
00:27:52:01  ACTUALLY HAVE TO WRITE A LOT OF
00:27:54:04  JAVASCRIPT FOR US, AND THAT
00:27:58:04  TELLS THE PYTHON TO TURN -- IN
00:28:01:19  HTML.
00:28:02:01  AND WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT
00:28:03:16  THIS IS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU
00:28:05:04  LIVE IN A WORLD OTHER THAN
00:28:06:19  PYTHON SOMETIMES, THERE ARE
00:28:07:28  OTHER LANGUAGES, OTHER LIBRARIES
00:28:09:22  THAT CAN ALSO CREATE THAT --
00:28:11:07  CREATE THAT JSON.
00:28:13:01  SO THERE'S R-BOKEH AND BOKEH
00:28:15:13  SCHOLAR AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS
00:28:16:25  THAT I'VE NEVER USED.
00:28:17:28  DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THEM, BUT
00:28:20:01  THEY EXIST AND SOME PEOPLE THINK
00:28:21:22  THEY'RE REALLY AWESOME.
00:28:23:01  ALSO, THERE'S A COMPATIBILITY
00:28:25:07  LAYER, THE FAR RIGHT THERE, SO
00:28:26:28  IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A WHOLE
00:28:28:19  BUNCH OF PLOTS IN MAP PLOT LIB
00:28:31:04  OR C BORN OR SOMETHING LIKE
00:28:32:28  THAT, THERE'S ALREADY A
00:28:34:19  COMPATIBILITY LAYER IN THERE, SO
00:28:37:22  THEY'LL COME OUT AS WEB
00:28:39:19  VISUALIZATIONS FOR YOU USING
00:28:40:28  BOKEH.
00:28:41:07  BUT TODAY WE'RE GONNA REALLY BE
00:28:43:25  FOCUSING ON THE CORE BOKEH
00:28:46:25  LIBRARY.
00:28:47:07  AND BOKEH ITSELF IS CERTAINLY
00:28:49:13  WHEN I CAME TO IT ABOUT A YEAR
00:28:51:01  AGO, THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF
00:28:54:13  WAYS YOU CAN USE IT, SO I'M
00:28:56:16  GONNA FOCUS ON TWO SORT OF
00:28:58:10  ASPECTS.
00:28:59:01  AND FOR ME THAT WAS -- THAT'S
00:29:01:13  ENOUGH TO GET A LOT DONE, AND I
00:29:03:25  THINK IT SHOWS THAT ACTUALLY
00:29:05:10  BOKEH'S PRETTY ACCESSIBLE.
00:29:07:01  SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING
00:29:08:10  TODAY IS WE'RE GONNA BE BUILDING
00:29:10:01  THE VISUALIZATION THAT YOU CAN
00:29:11:04  SEE HERE.
00:29:11:19  I WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED
00:29:13:25  APTIVATE.
00:29:16:01  WE'RE A NONPROFIT, AND WE BUILD
00:29:19:01  SOFTWARE FOR OTHER NONPROFITS.
00:29:21:01  ABOUT A YEAR AGO WE BUILT THIS
00:29:22:28  VISUALIZATION FOR WATER AID,
00:29:24:13  WHICH IS -- AND IT'S A MAP OF
00:29:25:28  WATER AND SANITATION IN AFRICA
00:29:27:28  AND HOW IT'S CHANGING OVER TIME.
00:29:29:22  IT'S BUILT IN D3.
00:29:31:07  AND THAT WAS A GOOD CHOICE AND I
00:29:33:13  THINK I WILL STILL BUILD IT IN
00:29:35:04  D3 IF I WAS DOING IT AGAIN
00:29:37:19  TODAY, BUT YOU CAN GO TO THE
00:29:39:25  GITHUB PAGE AND SEE THE ORIGINAL
00:29:41:19  CODE AS WELL AS GOING TO THE
00:29:43:10  CODE FOR THIS TALK TO SEE THE
00:29:45:01  BOKEH CODE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.
00:29:46:10  I MAY USE THE ACRONYM W.A.S.H. A
00:29:49:28  LOT TODAY.
00:29:50:19  AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE TERMS
00:29:52:13  THAT WE USE IN THE WATER AND
00:29:54:16  SANITATION WORLD.
00:29:55:16  SO HERE'S THE VISUALIZATION.
00:29:57:19  AND IT HAS A SLIDER.
00:29:59:28  AND IF I CLICK ON THE SANITATION
00:30:02:07  SIDE OF THINGS, YOU CAN SEE THE
00:30:03:25  COLORS CHANGE OVER TIME.
00:30:05:07  AND WE CAN HOVER OVER COUNTRIES
00:30:09:16  AND WE CAN PICK COUNTRIES.
00:30:11:13  AND SO WE'RE GONNA REMAKE --
00:30:13:28  OOPS, WE'RE GONNA REMAKE THIS
00:30:15:25  TODAY.
00:30:16:10  D3 ONE ON THE LEFT AND THE BOKEH
00:30:18:22  ONE THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE TODAY
00:30:20:01  IS ON THE RIGHT.
00:30:20:28  AND THERE AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE
00:30:22:19  THAT CAME IN LATE, THERE'S THE
00:30:24:22  LINK FOR THE CODE TO THIS TALK
00:30:27:04  AND THE SLIDES FOR THIS TALK,
00:30:28:07  AND I'LL TWEET ABOUT IT LATER AS
00:30:30:10  WELL.
00:30:30:22  SO WE'LL START WITH THE CHARTS
00:30:32:13  INTERFACE.
00:30:33:13  WHICH IS KIND OF AMAZING.
00:30:35:16  AND SO THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF
00:30:36:28  FUNCTIONS BUILT INTO BOKEH.
00:30:40:01  AND SO YOU IMPORT THE LINE.
00:30:43:07  WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE LINE
00:30:45:25  CHART THAT WAS ON THE
00:30:46:22  VISUALIZATION.
00:30:47:04  AND IMPORT THE LINE FUNCTION
00:30:48:25  FROM BOKEH.CHARTS.
00:30:50:22  YOU SHOVE IN YOUR DATA.
00:30:52:10  YOU USE THE SHOW METHOD.
00:30:54:25  AND THIS APPEARS.
00:30:55:28  AND THIS A FULLY WEB-IFIED
00:31:02:07  VISUALIZATION.
00:31:02:19  WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS.
00:31:04:19  WE HAVE A PAN TOOL THAT SORT OF
00:31:06:25  WORKING OUT THE BOX.
00:31:08:07  WE HAVE A ZOOM.
00:31:09:07  WE HAVE A RESIZE FUNCTION HERE.
00:31:11:07  SHOULD WE WANT TO DO THAT.
00:31:13:10  ZOOM.
00:31:13:28  SAVE IT.
00:31:14:25  RESET.
00:31:15:10  AND MOVE ON.
00:31:16:22  SO THAT'S PRETTY RAD.
00:31:18:04  AND THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF
00:31:21:04  THESE ALREADY BUILT IN.
00:31:22:16  YOU'VE GOT YOUR AREA CHARTS, BAR
00:31:25:04  PLOTS AND HEAT MAPS AND SO ON.
00:31:28:22  SO YOU CAN USE THESE STRAIGHT
00:31:30:16  AWAY.
00:31:30:28  SO HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN ROOM
00:31:32:28  WHO ALREADY SELF-IDENTIFIED AS
00:31:36:01  UNDERSTANDING PANDAS, YOU CAN
00:31:37:19  THROW THAT INTO ALL THE CHART
00:31:39:16  FUNCTIONS AND INTO BOKEH, AND
00:31:41:07  IT'S GONNA DO WHAT YOU WANT.
00:31:42:22  FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER
00:31:44:19  USED PANDAS BEFORE, IT'S ONE OF
00:31:46:28  THESE AWESOME TOOLS BUT IT HAS A
00:31:48:28  FAIRLY STEEP LEARNING CURVE, BUT
00:31:50:22  YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT
00:31:52:13  TOO MUCH TO REALLY GET GOING
00:31:53:22  WITH BOKEH.
00:31:54:19  WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT IF
00:31:56:22  YOU HAVE -- WHAT YOU NEED TO
00:31:59:07  KNOW IS BASICALLY AT THE END OF
00:32:00:19  THE DAY, IT'S JUST BASICALLY
00:32:02:19  DATA THAT LOOKS LIKE A TABLE.
00:32:04:16  AND SO IF YOU HAVE A CSV, YOU
00:32:07:04  CAN USE THE READ CSV METHOD.
00:32:11:22  IF LIKE ME YOU ARE MORE LIKELY
00:32:14:04  TO HAVE A DJANGO QUERY SET,
00:32:16:13  THEN -- AND THIS TOPIC LINE HERE
00:32:19:10  LOOKS SUPER FAMILIAR TO YOU,
00:32:21:13  THEN IN ORDER TO GET THAT INTO A
00:32:23:04  DATA FRAME, YOU TURN THAT INTO A
00:32:25:07  VALUES QUERY SET, AND THEN YOU
00:32:26:28  CAN USE THE FROM RECORDS METHOD.
00:32:29:25  WHICH WILL THEN TURN YOU -- YOUR
00:32:33:25  DJANGO QUERY SET INTO A PANDAS
00:32:36:10  DATA FRAME AND YOU'RE GOOD TO
00:32:39:01  GO.
00:32:39:10  AND YOU CAN DO IT FROM RAW SQL.
00:32:43:04  THAT ALL WORKS TOO.
00:32:45:04  AND THERE'S LOTS MORE
00:32:46:07  INFORMATION AT
00:32:46:22  PANDAS.PYDATA.ORG.
00:32:50:19  AND SO HERE YOU ARE.
00:32:52:07  YOU'RE LIKE YES, I'M GONNA MAKE
00:32:54:07  A DATA VISION.
00:32:55:10  YES, I USED MY CHART FUNCTION.
00:32:57:25  YOU WALK PAST YOUR DESIGNER, AND
00:33:00:19  YOUR DESIGNER IS LIKE, THIS DOES
00:33:03:16  NOT LOOK LIKE OUR WEBSITE.
00:33:04:25  AND SHE HAS SAD FACE.
00:33:06:10  AND SO IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO
00:33:07:28  THE DRAWING BOARD A LITTLE BIT,
00:33:09:10  AND YOU SHEEPISHLY WALK AWAY.
00:33:12:19  AND SO WE HAVE TWO WAYS TO MAKE
00:33:14:04  IT SHINY.
00:33:14:25  THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS ACTUALLY
00:33:16:19  ONE I USE A LOT, I CALL IT THE
00:33:20:22  REDUCTIVE APPROACH.
00:33:22:07  WE TAKE THAT CHART FUNCTION, THE
00:33:23:22  LINE FUNCTION, AND WE PASS IN
00:33:25:22  SOME ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS TO IT
00:33:28:04  TO START TO CLEAN IT UP.
00:33:29:25  WE GIVE IT THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH
00:33:33:19  WE WANT.
00:33:34:07  TAKE AWAY SOME OF THOSE GRID
00:33:36:10  LINES.
00:33:37:04  WE'VE TAKEN AWAY ALL THE TOOLS
00:33:39:22  BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED
00:33:41:19  THEM AND WE ARE MAKING SOME
00:33:43:07  PROGRESS.
00:33:43:28  BOKEH ACTUALLY COMES WITH A
00:33:45:13  WHOLE BUNCH OF BUILT-IN
00:33:47:01  PALLETTES WHICH IS REALLY HANDY
00:33:49:25  FOR MAKING THINGS LOOK NICE OUT
00:33:51:28  OF THE BOX.
00:33:52:19  SO THAT GETS US KIND OF FAR, BUT
00:33:55:22  REMEMBER WE'RE WORKING IN
00:33:57:01  PYTHON, AND SO WE HAVE A WHOLE
00:33:58:19  BUNCH OF PYTHON OBJECTS.
00:34:00:28  SO WE CAN START SETTING
00:34:02:19  ATTRIBUTES ON THOSE OBJECTS.
00:34:04:07  SO WE JUST SPECIFY AN X RANGE
00:34:07:22  AND A Y RANGE AND JUST START
00:34:09:25  SELLING THINGS OVER AND OVER
00:34:12:01  AGAIN.
00:34:12:13  AND WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE
00:34:13:13  TWEAKING, WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO
00:34:15:04  THIS.
00:34:15:13  AND AT THAT POINT I WILL MENTION
00:34:17:07  THAT WHEN I'M DOING THIS KIND OF
00:34:18:28  TWEAKING, I DO REALLY LOVE TO
00:34:21:04  WORK IN THE IPYTHON NOTEBOOK.
00:34:23:25  IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED IT, IT'S
00:34:25:16  REALLY GREAT FOR PROTOTYPING
00:34:28:07  VISUALIZATIONS IN BOKEH.
00:34:29:25  BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE AUTO
00:34:32:04  COMPLETE.
00:34:32:16  IT'S REALLY EASY TO JUST SEE
00:34:34:04  WHAT THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO
00:34:35:28  FIDDLE WITH.
00:34:36:19  SO I REALLY LOVE IT FOR
00:34:38:01  PROTOTYPING, AND IT WORKS NICELY
00:34:42:13  WITH PYTHON NOTEBOOK.
00:34:45:10  BUT WE CAN USE IT FOR DESIGN
00:34:47:25  WORK TOO.
00:34:48:07  SO THAT WAS NICE.
00:34:50:19  BUT WHERE WE'RE GOING IS
00:34:52:28  ACTUALLY TRYING TO BUILD THIS
00:34:54:19  VISUALIZATION WHICH HAS A LOT OF
00:34:55:25  COMPONENTS TO IT.
00:34:56:22  AND SO TO DO THIS, WE'RE GONNA
00:35:00:13  ACTUALLY START AGAIN AND WE'RE
00:35:01:25  GONNA START USING THAT LOW LEVEL
00:35:03:16  INTERFACE AND BUILDING THINGS UP
00:35:06:13  ONE A TIME.
00:35:07:07  I ALREADY SAID.
00:35:08:01  THE LOW LEVEL INTERFACE.
00:35:10:22  SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH A PLOT
00:35:12:13  OBJECT.
00:35:12:22  IF YOU -- WHEN YOU CREATE A PLOT
00:35:16:13  OBJECT, ALL YOU GET IS JUST AN
00:35:18:25  EMPTY SPACE, AND IT'S NOW YOUR
00:35:20:25  RESPONSIBILITY TO START ADDING
00:35:21:25  THINGS TO, AND THERE'S ONLY
00:35:23:10  REALLY THREE WAYS TO DO THAT.
00:35:25:01  YOU USE THE ADD GLYPH, THE ADD
00:35:27:10  LAYOUT, OR THE ADD TOOLS METHOD.
00:35:29:28  A QUICK INTERLUDE ON EMBEDDING
00:35:31:28  BECAUSE I'M SAYING ALL THIS, BUT
00:35:33:19  HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY GET INTO
00:35:35:07  YOUR WEB PAGE?
00:35:36:01  BOKEH HAS A COUPLE OF BUILT-IN
00:35:38:04  METHODS FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN.
00:35:40:07  THIS COMPONENTS METHOD HERE WILL
00:35:43:01  KICK OUT A SCRIPT AND A DIV AND
00:35:45:25  YOU CAN SHOVE THAT INTO YOUR
00:35:47:04  TEMPLATE.
00:35:47:19  I ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO SLIGHTLY
00:35:50:01  MORE COMPLEX THINGS.
00:35:51:04  I LIKE TO LOAD MY BOKEH JS
00:35:54:01  ASYNCHRONOUSLY.
00:35:57:07  AND YOU -- AND SO YOU CAN --
00:36:00:28  IT'S PRETTY EASY TO ROLL THIS
00:36:03:01  YOURSELF BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT
00:36:04:28  MAKE THOSE SCRIPT AND DIV AND IN
00:36:07:13  THE FIRST ARE JUST GINGER
00:36:09:28  TEMPLATES, AND SO YOU CAN GO AND
00:36:12:10  JUST COPY AND PASTE THEM FROM
00:36:13:22  THE BOKEH GITHUB REPO, AND THEN
00:36:17:22  TWEAK THEM TO YOUR OWN NEEDS.
00:36:19:25  AND IF YOU LOOK FOR THE CODE IN
00:36:21:10  THIS TALK, YOU'LL SEE ME DOING
00:36:23:04  THAT, AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER
00:36:23:25  MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.
00:36:25:07  AND I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THE CSS
00:36:27:16  A LITTLE BIT LATER.
00:36:28:04  SO FIRST WE'RE GONNA START
00:36:29:22  SIMPLE, AND WE'RE GONNA -- THERE
00:36:31:16  WAS THE LEGEND ON THE
00:36:33:04  VISUALIZATION.
00:36:33:13  AND THIS ISN'T ATTACHED TO ANY
00:36:35:13  DATA.
00:36:35:22  IT'S JUST ADDING SOME BLOBS ONTO
00:36:38:13  YOUR PAGE.
00:36:39:04  AND SO AT THE CORE OF BOKEH IS
00:36:41:19  THIS IDEA OF GLYPHS.
00:36:42:25  AND GLYPHS ARE JUST SHAPES.
00:36:46:19  I'VE FORGOTTEN WHY THEY LIKE TO
00:36:49:10  CALL THEM GLYPHS, BUT BASICALLY
00:36:51:13  THEY'RE JUST SHAPES.
00:36:53:13  AND SO YOU HAVE YOUR PLOT, AND
00:36:55:04  YOU JUST START ADDING GLYPHS.
00:36:59:22  AND 100 IS A GLYPH, AND WE JUST
00:37:02:25  ADD THE 100%.
00:37:05:13  BECAUSE WE ARE USING CANVAS AND
00:37:07:19  NOT SVG, WE NEED TO ACTUALLY
00:37:10:19  STYLE ALL OF OUR ELEMENTS.
00:37:12:10  WE PASS IN THE FONT, THE FONT
00:37:14:13  SIZE, JUST AS ARGUMENTS, INTO
00:37:16:28  THE -- WHEN WE INSTANTIATE THAT
00:37:19:13  CLASS.
00:37:19:22  SO WE START ADDING OUR GLYPHS.
00:37:22:19  AND WE CAN USE A FOUR LOOP TO
00:37:26:16  MAKE THIS NICE LAID OUT
00:37:29:01  RECTANGLE.
00:37:29:25  AND IT'S VERY PYTHONIC AND IT
00:37:31:13  WORKS.
00:37:31:28  SO THE NEXT THING WE NEED TO DO
00:37:33:19  IS START MAKING OUR MAP.
00:37:35:19  OUR MAP ACTUALLY HAS SOME DATA
00:37:37:25  BEHIND IT.
00:37:38:13  EACH COUNTRY HAS A DIFFERENT
00:37:39:22  VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, AND SO
00:37:40:28  WE NEED TO START PAIRING GLYPHS
00:37:42:19  WITH ACTUAL DATA.
00:37:43:16  AND SO THIS IS KIND OF TRICKY.
00:37:45:13  SO JUST BEAR WITH ME.
00:37:47:25  I'M KIDDING.
00:37:48:28  IT'S NOT TRICKY AT ALL.
00:37:51:04  IT'S REALLY, REALLY EASY.
00:37:52:28  AND SO THE -- SO IT REALLY IS --
00:37:57:04  IT'S DEVASTATINGLY SIMPLE, AND
00:37:59:13  IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JUST
00:38:00:19  MAKES ME HAPPY ABOUT BOKEH EVERY
00:38:03:04  DAY.
00:38:03:16  EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT PANDAS
00:38:06:13  DATA FRAMES, WHEN YOU GET INTO
00:38:07:25  THE REALLY LOW LEVEL OF BOKEH,
00:38:09:19  THEY HAVE A DATA STRUCTURE
00:38:11:22  CALLED A COLUMN DATA SOURCE.
00:38:13:22  YOU JUST PASS IT YOUR PANDAS
00:38:16:04  DATE FRAME.
00:38:16:25  IT'S NOT DIFFICULT.
00:38:17:22  SO WE MAKE YOUR COLUMN DATA
00:38:20:01  SOURCE.
00:38:20:13  AND THEN WHERE BEFORE WE HAD
00:38:22:01  JUST USED ADD GLYPH WITH JUST
00:38:24:04  THE GLYPH, NOW WE PASS IT THE
00:38:26:01  SOURCE AS WELL, AND IT'S GONNA
00:38:27:04  MAGICALLY JOIN THINGS TOGETHER.
00:38:30:22  AND SO HERE WE ARE.
00:38:31:16  WE USED -- WE USED A GLYPH TO
00:38:34:01  MAKE EACH OF THE COUNTRIES.
00:38:35:16  AND SO WE PASSED IT SOME XS, WE
00:38:38:19  PASSED IT SOME YS, AND WE PASSED
00:38:42:04  IT A COLOR, AND THAT CAME OUT.
00:38:44:13  AND WE'VE SORT OF MELDED
00:38:46:13  TOGETHER OUR KEY AND OUR MAP
00:38:48:13  RIGHT HERE.
00:38:49:22  SO THE NEXT THING, WE'RE GONNA
00:38:54:01  ADD THE TAP TOOL AND THE HOVER
00:38:56:10  TOOL.
00:38:56:19  THE TAP TOOL IS THE THING THAT
00:38:58:19  LETS YOU SELECT THINGS.
00:39:00:13  AND THE HOVER TOOL LETS YOU
00:39:02:10  HOVER.
00:39:02:19  SO THE TAP TOOL IS REALLY EASY
00:39:03:28  TO ADD.
00:39:04:16  YOU JUST INSTANTIATE TAP TOOL IN
00:39:08:07  ADD TOOLS TOOL.
00:39:09:13  FOR THE HOVER TOOL, YOU PASS IN
00:39:11:01  A STRING, AND YOU USE THIS
00:39:12:25  LITTLE -- YOU USE AN AT SIGN TO
00:39:17:13  SPECIFY THE COLUMN NAME THAT
00:39:19:13  YOU'D LIKE TO BE DISPLAYING.
00:39:20:28  AND SO YOU CAN JUST DO THIS VERY
00:39:23:01  SIMPLY AS I'VE SHOWN HERE, OR
00:39:25:16  YOU CAN WRITE FULL HTML IF YOU
00:39:30:13  WANT TO STYLE IT.
00:39:32:04  JUST USING THOSE AT SIGNS TO
00:39:34:01  DRIVE THE DATA.
00:39:35:07  AND SO WHEN WE DO THAT, WE HAVE
00:39:36:19  THIS AGAIN, BUT NOW WHEN WE
00:39:38:10  HOVER OVER, I'VE ADDED SOME CSS
00:39:41:19  TO MEET UP WITH THAT HOVER,
00:39:44:07  THOSE HOVER CLASSES, AND WHEN I
00:39:45:25  CLICK, WHEN I CLICK MY THINGS,
00:39:48:22  THEY'RE NOW RESPONDING TO THE
00:39:50:04  TAP.
00:39:50:16  SO YOU'RE REALLY SEEING HOW YOU
00:39:53:07  WROTE SOME PYTHON AND GOT OUT
00:39:55:04  SOME WONDERFUL HTML INTERACTION.
00:39:59:04  OOPS.
00:40:00:07  UH-OH.
00:40:02:28  OKAY.
00:40:07:04  SO... THIS IS WHEN THINGS START
00:40:11:07  TO GET EVEN MORE AWESOME.
00:40:12:22  EVERYTHING WE'RE WORKING WITH A
00:40:16:07  PYTHON OBJECT.
00:40:16:28  SO WE CAN START SHARING PYTHON
00:40:19:22  OBJECTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT
00:40:21:22  THINGS.
00:40:22:13  AND SO YOU MAY REMEMBER ON THE
00:40:25:22  ORIGINAL VISUALIZATION, THERE
00:40:26:22  WAS SOME STUFF ON THE RIGHT THAT
00:40:28:07  WAS RESPONDING TO WHEN WE
00:40:29:28  CLICKED ON MAP.
00:40:31:07  AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE
00:40:33:01  OUR SOURCE THAT WE'VE ALREADY
00:40:35:04  CREATED, AND WE CAN NOT ONLY
00:40:36:22  HAVE THAT ONE SOURCE DRIVE THE
00:40:38:07  MAP PLOT, BUT WE CAN ALSO HAVE
00:40:39:25  IT DRIVE THE TEXT PLOT.
00:40:41:22  AND SO WHEN WE DO THAT, HERE'S
00:40:44:25  SOME NEW SORT OF EMPTY TEXT THAT
00:40:47:10  I'VE ADDED, AND THERE'S SOME
00:40:48:25  SORT OF HOLES HERE, BUT NOW WHEN
00:40:50:19  I CLICK A BOX, THAT SAME ROW OF
00:40:52:28  DATA IS PAIRING BOTH THE -- BOTH
00:40:56:19  THE MAP AND THAT TEXT BOX AT THE
00:40:58:25  TOP, AND THESE TWO ARE JUST
00:41:00:13  LINKED TOGETHER BY VIRTUE OF
00:41:02:07  THEIR SHARING THE SAME OBJECT.
00:41:04:16  SO THE -- THE NEXT PIECE IS JUST
00:41:10:25  TO GET THAT WATER AND SANITATION
00:41:12:19  PIECE GOING.
00:41:13:13  SO WE -- WE HAVE OUR WATER, TEXT
00:41:16:25  BOX.
00:41:17:01  WE HAVE OUR WATER MAP.
00:41:19:28  WE NOW GO AND REPEAT THE SAME
00:41:21:22  THING TO MAKE THE SANITATION
00:41:22:28  VERSION OF IT, AND WE USE THE
00:41:25:25  WIDGETS THAT BOKEH PROVIDES TO
00:41:28:10  STITCH IT ALL TOGETHER INTO
00:41:30:16  TABS.
00:41:31:07  AND THIS IS WHERE -- WHEN YOU
00:41:33:07  DIG IN A LITTLE BIT, YOU SEE
00:41:34:13  THAT A LOT OF TIME, WHEN YOU'RE
00:41:35:22  MAKING A PLOT, BOKEH'S USING
00:41:39:04  CANVAS TO MAKE THAT.
00:41:40:25  BUT WHEN YOU START USING SOME OF
00:41:42:10  THESE WIDGETS, IT ACTUALLY
00:41:44:04  STARTS TO INJECT SOME LITTLE
00:41:45:25  BITS OF HTML TO MAKE THAT
00:41:47:22  HAPPEN.
00:41:48:01  AND SO HERE IT IS.
00:41:51:01  WE'VE USED THE TABS, AND NOW WE
00:41:53:01  HAVE OUR TWO TABS FOR WATER AND
00:41:55:01  SANITATION.
00:41:56:19  WE'VE SHARED THE DATA SOURCE
00:41:58:01  ACROSS ALL THESE ELEMENTS.
00:41:59:22  SO NOW WHEN I CLICK MALI IN
00:42:02:01  SANITATION, IT'S BEING SELECTED
00:42:03:28  OVER IN WATER.
00:42:04:19  AND IT'S ALL WORKING TOGETHER
00:42:07:10  REALLY QUITE NICELY.
00:42:08:13  BUT NOW WE WANT TO GET THAT
00:42:12:25  SLIDER WORKING.
00:42:14:01  AND SO TO GET THAT SLIDER
00:42:15:16  WORKING, WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY
00:42:17:10  GONNA DO IS, WE'RE GONNA UPDATE
00:42:18:28  THE DATA SOURCE.
00:42:20:01  WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY HAVE THE
00:42:21:22  DATA CHANGE WHEN WE MOVE THE
00:42:23:07  SLIDER, AND TO DO THIS, WE BRING
00:42:25:13  IN THE BOKEH SERVER.
00:42:26:25  AND WHAT THE BOKEH SERVER DOES
00:42:30:10  IS, NOW INSTEAD OF THAT CODE
00:42:32:13  COMING DOWN TO YOUR CLIENT, YOU
00:42:35:04  PREPARE YOUR CODE, BUT YOU SEND
00:42:37:19  AN INSTRUCTION TO THE SERVER,
00:42:39:07  HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND TO
00:42:41:25  THE DATA?
00:42:42:10  AND SO WHEN YOUR CLIENT WANTS TO
00:42:44:13  GET THE PLOT, THE JSON COMES
00:42:48:01  DOWN THE SERVER, BUT A WEB
00:42:56:04  SOCKET CONNECTION ALSO GETS --
00:42:59:01  PUSHED RIGHT DOWN FOR YOU.
00:43:00:28  SO TO DO THAT, WE -- WE CREATE
00:43:04:19  WHAT I CALL AS LIKE A SERVER
00:43:06:19  APP, LIKE A -- LIKE A BOKEH APP.
00:43:11:07  AND IN PARTICULAR, WE WANT TO
00:43:12:25  SPECIFY THE INSTANCES OF THINGS
00:43:15:07  THAT THE SERVER NEEDS TO CARE
00:43:16:19  ABOUT.
00:43:16:28  THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WHEN
00:43:18:28  THEY CHANGE OR WHEN THEY UPDATE
00:43:20:28  LIKE THE SERVER NEEDS TO KNOW
00:43:22:10  ABOUT.
00:43:22:19  AND THIS KIND OF BLUEPRINT NEEDS
00:43:24:07  TO -- IF YOU -- SOMETIMES YOU
00:43:26:10  HOST YOUR BOKEH SERVER AND YOUR
00:43:28:13  WEB APPLICATION SERVER ON THE
00:43:30:01  SAME PLACE -- AND IT'S TOTALLY
00:43:33:01  EASY, AND THE BOKEH EXAMPLES
00:43:34:16  SHOW IT REALLY NICELY, BUT
00:43:36:01  SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO HOST THEM
00:43:37:13  IN DIFFERENT PLACES, AND THEN
00:43:39:04  YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH
00:43:40:22  THE SERVER AND YOUR ORIGINAL WEB
00:43:42:28  APP HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT
00:43:44:13  HOW TO PUT YOUR BOKEH APP
00:43:45:28  TOGETHER.
00:43:46:10  SO YOU HAVE THESE INSTANCES
00:43:50:16  SPECIFIED.
00:43:51:10  AND ON YOUR WEB APP, YOU JUST GO
00:43:55:16  THROUGH THE REGULAR THING OF
00:43:56:19  CREATING THE PLOT.
00:43:58:01  YOU MAKE THE MAP.
00:43:58:28  YOU MAKE THE TEXT BOX.
00:44:00:04  YOU PUT THE DATA.
00:44:02:01  YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.
00:44:03:10  IT'S NICE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD.
00:44:04:25  AND ON THE SERVER SIDE, YOU
00:44:06:10  START BINDING EVENTS TO THOSE
00:44:08:01  OBJECTS.
00:44:08:19  SO THE YEAR SLIDER THAT WE'RE
00:44:11:19  GONNA SEE, WHEN THAT VALUE
00:44:14:07  CHANGES, WE'RE GONNA SAY, PLEASE
00:44:17:07  CALL THE CHANGE YEAR METHOD.
00:44:19:13  WHAT IT'S GONNA DO, THE REAL
00:44:21:04  MAGIC HERE IS WHEN
00:44:23:25  SELF.SOURCE.DATA CHANGES, AND ON
00:44:26:25  THE SERVER SIDE, THE SERVER THEN
00:44:28:28  KNOWS, OH, I'VE UPDATED.
00:44:31:01  SHOOT THAT BACK DOWN TO THE
00:44:32:07  CLIENT.
00:44:32:22  AND THAT'S THE MAGIC THAT REALLY
00:44:34:07  LETS BOKEH DO SOME REALLY
00:44:36:13  POWERFUL THINGS.
00:44:37:13  SO NOW WE'VE DONE THAT.
00:44:39:10  WE'RE ALL DONE.
00:44:41:16  HERE'S OUR SLIDER.
00:44:44:22  OH, HANG ON.
00:44:45:16  ACTUALLY, THIS IS MUCH CLEARER
00:44:47:22  ON THIS -- OH.
00:44:48:19  THAT IS AWKWARD.
00:44:51:22  I THINK I EMBEDDED THE WRONG
00:44:54:07  THING.
00:44:54:16  OKAY.
00:44:57:07  IT TOTALLY WORKS.
00:44:59:07  I'M VERY SORRY.
00:45:00:13  AND I WILL TWEET YOU THE LINK
00:45:02:07  LATER IF I CAN'T GET IT TO WORK
00:45:04:10  MAGICALLY NOW, BUT I'M GONNA
00:45:06:16  KEEP GOING BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A
00:45:08:10  BIT SHORT ON TIME.
00:45:09:22  SO... SO SOME OF YOU MAY BE
00:45:14:07  SITTING THERE THINKING, DO I
00:45:16:07  REALLY NEED TO SET UP AN ENTIRE
00:45:18:13  SERVER TO HAVE A SLIDER ON MY
00:45:20:16  DATA VISUALIZATION?
00:45:21:13  AND THAT IS A PRETTY FAIR
00:45:22:28  QUESTION.
00:45:24:01  THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, BUT.
00:45:29:01  AND THE YES, BUT IS MULTIFOLD.
00:45:32:25  SO THE FIRST THING IS, THERE IS
00:45:35:04  REALLY AWESOME THING COMING INTO
00:45:37:16  BOKEH IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
00:45:39:01  CALLED THE JAVASCRIPT ACTIONS
00:45:40:28  FRAMEWORK, AND THAT IS GONNA LET
00:45:42:16  YOU START WRITING LITTLE PIECES
00:45:44:19  OF PYTHON CODE THAT ACTUALLY
00:45:46:16  MAKE JAVASCRIPT ACTIONS HAPPEN.
00:45:48:16  AND THERE'S ALREADY ONE OF THEM
00:45:49:28  IN THE REPO CALLED OPEN URL, BUT
00:45:52:25  THAT EXACT ACTION FRAMEWORK IS
00:45:54:13  TOTALLY WHAT I WOULD USE TO
00:45:56:13  POWER THAT SLIDER, AND SO THAT'S
00:45:58:13  COMING REALLY SOON.
00:45:59:22  THE SECOND THING IS, THAT I --
00:46:02:22  THIS IS A PRETTY TRIVIAL
00:46:05:07  EXAMPLE, BUT THE SERVER IS
00:46:06:19  REALLY AWESOME, AND YOU WILL
00:46:08:13  ALMOST CERTAINLY WANT TO USE IT
00:46:10:01  FOR MUCH MORE COMPLICATED AND
00:46:12:01  INTERESTING THINGS THAN WHAT WE
00:46:13:13  JUST DID.
00:46:13:28  DATA MANIPULATION, DOWNPLAYING,
00:46:17:16  LIKE IF YOU HAVE -- LET'S SAY
00:46:19:07  YOU HAVE A LINE WITH 10 MILLION
00:46:20:22  POINTS IN IT, SO YOU START
00:46:23:07  REALLY ZOOMED OUT.
00:46:24:07  JUST THE SET OF DATA WE CAN SEE,
00:46:26:10  YOU CAN HAVE YOUR USER ZOOM IN
00:46:28:07  AND ZOOM IN AND ZOOM IN AND JUST
00:46:30:10  BE SENDING THE DATA THAT THEY
00:46:32:01  CAN ACTUALLY SEE.
00:46:33:01  YOU CAN BE STREAMING YOUR DATA.
00:46:34:25  YOU CAN HAVE SOME EXTERNAL
00:46:36:13  SOURCE LIKE ALWAYS BE UPDATING
00:46:38:16  YOUR PLOT SOURCE, AND THEN THOSE
00:46:40:13  DATA CHANGES ARE GONNA COME DOWN
00:46:42:01  TO YOUR PLOT.
00:46:42:28  AND LASTLY THERE'S ALWAYS BOKEH
00:46:49:13  JS.
00:46:49:28  AND ACTUALLY I DON'T USE IT
00:46:52:10  MUCH, BUT I USE IT TO MAKE MY
00:46:54:16  PLOTS RESPONSIVE.
00:46:55:16  SO IN WEB DESIGN, PEOPLE HAVE
00:46:57:28  ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF BROWSER
00:46:59:10  SIZES, SO I DON'T WANT MY PLOT
00:47:01:07  TO ONLY LOOK NICE ON ONE SIZE OF
00:47:04:13  BROWSER, SO I USE IT TO RESIZE
00:47:08:13  MY PLOTS WHENEVER THE WINDOW
00:47:10:04  SIZE CHANGES, AND THE CODE FOR
00:47:12:01  THAT IS IN THIS REPO TALK AND
00:47:15:04  YOU CAN GO AND CHECK THAT OUT.
00:47:17:13  SO SOME WRAP-UP THOUGHTS.
00:47:19:01  BACK TO THE HIGH LEVEL SHOTS,
00:47:21:13  THEY'RE AN AWESOME WAY TO GET
00:47:23:16  STARTED.
00:47:24:01  I USE THEM ALL THE TIME.
00:47:25:22  I OFTEN USE THEM IN A KIND OF
00:47:27:28  FRANKENSTEINY KIND OF WAY WHERE
00:47:30:13  I WILL START WITH A CHART, TAKE
00:47:31:22  A BUNCH OF STUFF OUT, THEN ADD
00:47:34:07  SOME GLYPHS AND MASH SOME STUFF
00:47:36:22  UP LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S A
00:47:38:07  REALLY FAST WAY TO GET SOMETHING
00:47:39:22  UP.
00:47:40:01  THE SECOND THING IS ABOUT CSS.
00:47:43:10  IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S
00:47:45:01  JUST IN CANVAS, YOU DON'T NEED
00:47:47:13  ANY CSS.
00:47:48:22  BUT SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE THE
00:47:50:22  HOVER STYLINGS, THE WIDGETS THAT
00:47:52:25  WE USED, THE SLIDER, THAT NEEDS
00:47:54:13  SOME CSS.
00:47:55:28  UNFORTUNATELY, BOKEH'S CURRENT
00:48:00:04  BUILD IN CSS IS ABOUT A
00:48:02:19  MEGABYTE, AND THAT'S TOO BIG FOR
00:48:04:19  ME.
00:48:04:28  ROLL MY OWN CSS FOR MY WEB
00:48:07:04  APPLICATION.
00:48:07:13  SOME FINAL THOUGHTS.
00:48:11:04  IN THE BOKEH REPO, THERE IS AN
00:48:13:07  EXAMPLES FOLDER.
00:48:14:01  ON THE BOKEH.PY DATA WEBSITE,
00:48:18:04  THERE IS A GALLERY WHICH HAS
00:48:20:19  MAYBE 20 OR SO EXAMPLES IN IT,
00:48:22:16  BUT IN THE EXAMPLES FOLDER,
00:48:23:22  THERE'S LIKE WELL OVER 100
00:48:25:28  EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU COULD DO
00:48:27:19  EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY
00:48:28:25  THINK OF.
00:48:29:25  AND SO I TOTALLY RECOMMEND USING
00:48:31:13  THAT AS A RESOURCE TO REALLY DIG
00:48:33:10  IN TO HOW BOKEH WORKS.
00:48:35:04  THE BOKEH TEAM ARE PLANNING TO
00:48:37:07  HAVE 1.0 UP BY THE END OF YEAR,
00:48:41:25  SO IT'S COME A LONG WAY IN A
00:48:44:04  YEAR, AND IT'S REALLY STARTING
00:48:45:13  TO KIND OF BED DOWN AND BE NICE
00:48:47:01  AND STABLE AND REALLY USEABLE.
00:48:49:01  LASTLY, IF YOU WANT TO GET A
00:48:51:13  SERVER UP AND RUNNING, IT CAN A
00:48:53:19  LITTLE BIT TRICKY, BUT I HAVE A
00:48:55:01  REPO YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN,
00:48:56:04  WHICH IS HOW GET YOUR SERVER
00:48:59:04  DEPLOYED ONTO HEROKU.
00:49:01:10  I LOVE BOKEH, AND THERE IS SO
00:49:02:19  MUCH MORE THAT I WISH I COULD
00:49:04:10  HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY.
00:49:05:25  I'M AROUND DURING THE SPRINTS.
00:49:07:28  COME AND FIND ME, OR THE BOKEH
00:49:09:22  COMMUNITY IS REALLY, REALLY
00:49:11:10  FRIENDLY.
00:49:11:22  CHECK OUT THE GOOGLE GROUP, AND
00:49:14:22  AGAIN, THE CODE FOR THIS SLIDE
00:49:16:19  IS ONLINE.
00:49:18:10  SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:49:19:01  [ Applause ]
00:49:20:04  YEAH, THAT'S FINE.
00:49:28:25  >> WE HAVE TIME FOR JUST ONE OR
00:49:31:16  TWO QUESTIONS, IF YOU WANT TO
00:49:33:01  COME TO THE MICROPHONE HERE.
00:49:34:22  AS ALWAYS, WE PLAY BY JEOPARDY
00:49:39:07  RULES.
00:49:40:16  YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE IN THE
00:49:41:28  FORM OF A QUESTION.
00:49:42:22  >> EXCELLENT TALK.
00:49:43:16  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:49:44:07  YOU OBVIOUSLY LIKE THE
00:49:45:04  FRAMEWORK.
00:49:45:22  CAN YOU JUST QUICKLY SAY HOW
00:49:47:28  FAST IT WAS FOR YOU TO COME UP
00:49:49:16  TO SPEED?
00:49:51:10  YOU KNOW, HOW GOOD WAS IT TO
00:49:53:04  COME UP TO SPEED?
00:49:55:19  WHAT WAS YOUR RAMP UP?
00:49:57:07  >> I WOULD SAY THAT'S A HARD
00:49:58:28  QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE I
00:50:00:01  STARTED WITH BOKEH ABOUT A
00:50:01:13  LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO WHEN IT
00:50:03:16  WAS AT 0.4, AND SO EVERYTHING
00:50:06:10  WAS CHANGING KIND OF FAST, AND
00:50:07:22  THE DOCUMENTATION WASN'T WHERE
00:50:08:28  IT SHOULD BE.
00:50:09:22  THERE HAS BEEN HUGE PUSH IN THE
00:50:11:25  LAST, LIKE, MONTH OR SO ON THE
00:50:13:07  DOCUMENTATION, AND THEY'RE STILL
00:50:14:19  DOING IT, AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY
00:50:17:25  VERY EASY TO USE WITH THE
00:50:20:01  COMPONENTS THAT I SHOWED YOU.
00:50:21:28  I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER
00:50:23:28  TO GET STARTED TODAY THAN
00:50:25:10  TOMORROW.
00:50:25:19  AND IF I FAIL TO LIVE UP TO THAT
00:50:27:22  PROMISE, YOU CAN HUNT ME DOWN ON
00:50:29:16  THE INTERNET, AND I WILL HELP
00:50:31:10  OUT WITH THAT, SO --
00:50:33:22  >> WITH THE W.A.S.H. PROJECT,
00:50:35:10  YOU MENTIONED IT WAS IN D3, AND
00:50:38:04  IT ENDED UP STAYING IN D3.
00:50:41:04  AND YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU
00:50:43:04  WOULD STILL DO IT IN D3.
00:50:45:10  IS THERE A REASON WHY?
00:50:47:04  >> YES, FOR TODAY BECAUSE OF THE
00:50:49:01  SLIDER.
00:50:49:16  SO IF YOU ASK ME, IF I WAS DOING
00:50:52:22  THIS AGAIN IN THREE MONTHS TIME,
00:50:54:28  WHEN THAT JAVASCRIPT ACTIONS
00:50:56:25  FRAMEWORK IS AVAILABLE, THEN I
00:50:58:07  THINK IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, I
00:51:00:10  WOULD HAVE TO SEARCH FOR A
00:51:01:13  REASON NOT TO USE BOKEH IN THAT
00:51:03:16  INSTANCE, BUT AS OF TODAY,
00:51:05:19  TODAY, I WOULD STILL GO WITH D3.
00:51:10:10  >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TALK.
00:51:11:22  I WANTED TO ASK IF YOU HAD
00:51:14:28  OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE PROS
00:51:16:13  AND CONS OF USING CANVAS OR WEB
00:51:19:16  GL FOR RENDERING RATHER THAN
00:51:22:04  SVG.
00:51:23:10  >> THAT IS NOT MY FIELD OF
00:51:25:04  EXPERTISE.
00:51:25:19  I -- THERE ARE WHOLE THINGS
00:51:29:13  ABOUT WHICH IS FASTER AND WHICH
00:51:31:25  INSTANCES AND SO ON, AND THERE
00:51:33:16  ARE BLOG POSTS ON THE INTERNET
00:51:35:16  THAT WILL ANSWER THAT MUCH
00:51:38:01  BETTER THAN I CAN.
00:51:39:01  BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S
00:51:39:28  SOME REALLY OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS
00:51:41:13  WHEN YOU WANT TO THROW ANY KIND
00:51:43:22  OF DECENT SIZED AMOUNT OF DATA
00:51:47:01  AT IT.
00:51:47:16  AT SOME LEVEL, I THINK THEY'VE
00:51:49:01  BECOME A BIT OF A TOSS-UP, BUT
00:51:52:25  PEOPLE MUCH SMARTER THAN ME CAN
00:51:54:22  ANSWER THAT MUCH BETTER, I'M
00:51:56:10  SURE.
00:51:56:19  >> GREAT.
00:51:57:10  LET'S THANK SARAH ONE MORE TIME.
