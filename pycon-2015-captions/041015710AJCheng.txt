01:57:12   >> HELLO, WELCOME, EVERYBODY.
01:57:14   THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TO THE...
01:57:16   [ MICROPHONE FEEDBACK ]
01:57:20   >> WELCOME TO THE LAST OF OUR THREE SESSIONS ON
01:57:23   THINGS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN THE WORLD.
01:57:27   I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE JENNY CHENG TO TALK ABOUT
01:57:34   3D PRINTING WITH THE BLENDER API.
01:57:36   [ Applause ]
01:57:43   >> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.
01:57:44   I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD CONFERENCE SO FAR.
01:57:47   IT'S GOING TO BECOME A GREAT CONFERENCE IN JUST A
01:57:50   MOMENT BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE HERE AT 3D PRINT
01:57:53   ANYTHING WITH THE BLENDER API.
01:57:55   MY NAME IS JENNY CHENG A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IN
01:58:00   NEW YORK AND I DO A LOT OF 3D PRINTING AS A HOBBY
01:58:03   SO FOR THE NEXT 30 MINUTES, I'M GOING TO SHARE
01:58:06   THAT HOBBY WITH YOU SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GO OUT
01:58:08   AND START MAKING YOUR OWN CREATIONS.
01:58:10   YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT 3D PRINTING BEFORE.
01:58:17   IT IS AN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.
01:58:19   WHAT THIS MEANS, IT BUILDS AN OBJECT UP LAYER BY
01:58:22   LAYER BY LAYER.
01:58:24   YOU CAN CONTRAST THIS WITH OTHER MANUFACTURING
01:58:26   PROCESSES, LIKE C & C MACHINING, WHERE YOU TAKE A
01:58:30   BLOCK OF MATERIAL AND CUT AWAY AT IT TO LEAVE
01:58:33   YOUR FINAL OBJECT.
01:58:35   THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF 3D PRINTERS
01:58:38   OUT THERE.
01:58:38   THEY USE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES, LIKE LASERS,
01:58:43   EXTRUDERS WHICH ARE SQUEEZING MATERIAL THROUGH A
01:58:45   LITTLE NOZZLE AND BINDERS WHICH SORT OF USE A
01:58:51   GLUE-LIKE MATERIAL TO BIND PARTICLES TOGETHER.
01:58:55   YOU CAN 3D PRINT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS,
01:58:58   LIKE PLASTIC, METAL AND EVEN CERAMIC.
01:59:05   THERE'S LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES, VERY GOOD FOR
01:59:08   RAPIDLY PROTOTYPING OBJECTS OR MAKING VERY CUSTOM
01:59:11   OBJECTS.
01:59:12   3D PRINTING IS NOT A NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S ONE
01:59:16   THAT'S BECOME READILY AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS.
01:59:20   WITH THE RISE OF DESKTOP 3D PRINTERS AND ONLINE
01:59:23   SERVICES WHERE YOU SEND THEM A MODEL AND THEY'LL
01:59:27   MAIL YOU THE MODEL BACK 3D-PRINTED, ALL YOU
01:59:31   REALLY NEED IS 3D MODEL TO GET STARTED WITH 3D
01:59:34   PRINTING.
01:59:35   SO LET'S TALK ABOUT 3D MODELS.
01:59:41   THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIONS OF 3D
01:59:43   MODELS.
01:59:43   ONE COMMON REPRESENTATION IS TO REPRESENT YOUR 3D
01:59:47   MODEL AS A SET OF VERTICES, EDGES AND FACES.
01:59:54   SO THIS 3D CUBE WE HAVE HERE HAS A SET OF
01:59:57   VERTICES, THEY ARE THE CORNERS OF THE CUBES.
02:00:02   EACH VERTEX IS A POINT IN SPACE, IT, IT HAS AN X
02:00:14   COORDINATE AND A Y COORDINATE.
02:00:17   THE VERTICES WILL BE THE EDGES OF THE CUBE.
02:00:20   AND FACES ARE WHAT'S BOUND BY THE SET OF EDGES.
02:00:24   THEY REPRESENT THE SURFACE, SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE
02:00:27   FRONT FACING SQUARE IS A NAYS.
02:00:34   WITH MODELING AUTHOR 3D PRINTING, THE FACES ARE
02:00:38   OFTEN TRIANGULATED OR CUT UP INTO TRIANGLES
02:00:42   INSTEAD OF BEING SQUARE.
02:00:45   SO THE VERTICES YOU NEED THE 3D FILE TO REPRESENT
02:00:58   THE MODEL.
02:00:58   SDL FORMAT IS A POPULAR FORMAT TO CONTAIN THE
02:01:06   INFORMATION ABOUT THE VERTICES AND FACES.
02:01:10   HERE WE HAVE AN ASCII VERSION OF THE FILE, IT'S
02:01:14   JUST TEXT, ESSENTIALLY A TEXT FILE WITH NUMBERS
02:01:17   INDICATING COORDINATES FOR THE VERTICES.
02:01:21   THERE IS A BINARY VERSION OF XTL WHICH IS
02:01:25   COMPRESSED THE ASCII STL.
02:01:29   SO HERE WE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRST BLOCK, THIS
02:01:34   BLOCK REPRESENTS THE FACE THAT'S HIGHLIGHTnd
02:01:38   BLUE, THE TRIANGULAR FACE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
02:01:41   CUBE, AND EACH ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTED VERTEX MAPS
02:01:45   TO ONE OF THE VERTEX -- VERTICES ON THAT BOTTOM
02:01:49   OF THE CUBE.
02:01:50   YOU MIGHT NOTICE THERE IS A NORMAL UP HERE, MIGHT
02:01:56   BE A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BUT ASIDE FROM VERTICES
02:02:03   EDGES AND FACES, EVERY FACE HAS A NORMAL.
02:02:06   WHAT THIS MEANS IS EVERY FACE HAS A SIDE-EDNESS
02:02:12   TO IT, AN INSIDE AND AN OUTSIDE, AND THE
02:02:16   DIRECTION OF THE NORMAL IS WHAT THE OUTSIDE OF
02:02:18   THE FACE IS.
02:02:18   SO HERE WE HAVE THE NORMAL BEING ZERO, ZERO,
02:02:26   NEGATIVE ONE, WHICH IS ZERO IN THE EXTRACTION,
02:02:29   ZERO IN THE Y DIRECTION AND NEGATIVE ONE IN THE Z
02:02:33   DIRECTION, SO THIS NORMAL VECTOR POINTS
02:02:35   DOWNWARDS, AND THIS IS ASSIGNED TO A SPACE ON THE
02:02:42   BOTTOM OF THE CUBE WHICH MAKES SENSE SINCE THE
02:02:44   NORMAL CORRELATES TO THE OUTSIDEDNESS OF THE
02:02:46   FACE, YOU WANT YOUR OUTSIDE OF THE BOTTOM FACE OF
02:02:51   YOUR CUBE TO BE DOWNWARDS.
02:02:53   SO IF YOU KNOW ALL THE COORDINATES OF YOUR
02:02:57   IMAGINARY 3D MODEL, YOU CAN JUST USE YOUR
02:03:02   FAVORITE SOFTWARE OR FAVORITE PROGRAM LANGUAGE TO
02:03:06   OUTPUT A TEXT FILE WITH A SERIES OF COORDINATES
02:03:09   LIKE THIS AND SEND THAT OFF TO BE 3D PRINTED.
02:03:14   THIS -- WHERE IT GET TEDIOUS IS, LET'S SAY YOU
02:03:17   HAVE YOUR MODEL BUT NOW YOU SUDDENLY WANTED TO
02:03:19   SCALE IT UP, MAYBE YOU WANT TO SCALE ONLY A
02:03:21   PORTION OF IT OR ROTATE A LITTLE PIECE AND NOW
02:03:25   YOU START WRITING A LOT OF MATHEMATICAL
02:03:30   FUNCTIONS.
02:03:31   LUCKILY FOR YOU, A LOT OF 3D GRAPHIC SOFTWARE
02:03:34   ALREADY PROVIDES THESE FUNCTIONALITY FOR YOU SO
02:03:36   YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE IT FROM SCRATCH.
02:03:38   THERE'S A LOT OF 3D GRAPHIC SOFTWARE OUT THERE.
02:03:42   IF YOU COME FROM AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND, YOU
02:03:46   MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH SOLID WORKS OR AUTOCAD.
02:03:50   IF YOU COME FROM GRAPHICS, YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR
02:03:53   WITH MAYA OR 3D STUDIO MAX OR EVEN RINA.
02:03:58   BLENDER IS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE 3D GRAPHIC
02:04:01   SOFTWARE AND IT'S ONE THAT I REALLY, REALLY LIKE.
02:04:06   IT'S OPEN SOURCE, UNDER GPL AND HAS A VERY LARGE
02:04:11   AND FRIENDLY COMMUNITY.
02:04:12   HAS A LOT OF MAILING LISTS, RSC CHANNELS.
02:04:14   FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND PEOPLE WILL BE
02:04:17   HAPPY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS.
02:04:18   IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF FEATURES, ASIDE FROM
02:04:23   MODELING AND GRAPHICS.
02:04:24   IT HAS VIDEO EDITOR, AS WELL AS A GAME ENGINE,
02:04:28   AND BECAUSE IT'S OPEN SOURCE, A LOT OF PEOPLE
02:04:32   CONTRIBUTE BACK TO IT SO THERE IS A MYRIAD OF
02:04:35   DIFFERENT ADD-ONS.
02:04:37   BLENDER RUNS ON LINUX, MAX AND WINDOWS, AND IT
02:04:43   HAS A PYTHON API, WHICH IS WHAT I FIND REALLY
02:04:48   COOL ABOUT BLENDER.
02:04:49   THE PYTHON API IS CALLED BPI.
02:04:52   SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT BLENDER.
02:04:55   SO THIS IS BLENDER.
02:04:56   WHEN YOU FIRST START UP PROVIDES A DEFAULT CUBE
02:05:03   FOR YOU TO WORK WITH.
02:05:04   WHEN YOU FIRST START UP, YOU CAN REMOVE THAT IF
02:05:06   YOU WISH.
02:05:07   GOING TO HIT A BUTTON THAT SAYS "SCRIPTING."
02:05:09   THIS SCRIPTING BUTTON IS JUST FOR SETTING UP MY
02:05:15   WINDOWS, SO IT WILL ASK ME TO SCRIPT EASIER.
02:05:19   YOU CAN REARRANGE THE WINDOWS HOWEVER YOU LIKE,
02:05:22   BUT THIS IS JUST NEAT SHORTCUT TO GET SET UP
02:05:27   FASTER.
02:05:28   SO I'M GOING TO CLOSE ONE OF THESE WINDOWS AND
02:05:30   WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT ONE LATER.
02:05:32   INSTEAD, YOU SEE IN THE MIDDLE, THERE IS A 3D
02:05:36   VIEW, THE SAME 3D VIEW WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED,
02:05:38   AND ON THE BOTTOM, THERE IS A PYTHON TRACKTIVE
02:05:47   CONSOLE.
02:05:47   SO THIS IS LIKE A RIPPLE, YOU CAN START PRINTING
02:05:50   COMMANDS LIKE PRINT HELLO PYCON AND IT WILL
02:05:53   EVALUATE AND PRINT THAT.
02:05:55   SO LET'S START MAKING STUFF.
02:06:02   BLENDER HAS -- PROVIDES A LOT OF STOCK OBJECTS,
02:06:07   LIKE CUBES, CYLINDER, CONES AND MONKEY NAMED
02:06:14   SUZANNE.
02:06:15   SO YOU CAN START CREATING OBJECTS BY HITTING
02:06:22   CREATE, A CUBE BUTTON AND OUT WILL POP A CUBE.
02:06:26   NOW I'M GOING TO HOVER OVER THE CUBE BUTTON THAT
02:06:30   I JUST PRESSED AND A TOOL TIP WILL POP UP WITH
02:06:34   THE PYTHON API EQUIVALENT, SO I CAN JUST ENTER
02:06:39   THAT COMMAND INTO THE INTERACTIVE CONSOLE AND IT
02:06:43   WILL DO THE EXACT SAME THING.
02:06:45   BLENDER ALSO PROVIDES ANOTHER NEAT FUNCTIONALITY
02:06:51   IN THAT ALL THE ACTIONS YOU DO WILL BE LOGGED AS
02:06:55   THEIR API EQUIVALENTS AND IT WILL ALSO LOG THEIR
02:06:58   PARAMETERS SO YOU CAN REPLICATE WHAT YOU JUST DID
02:07:01   VERY EASILY.
02:07:02   SO HERE I'M GOING TO TYPE IN THE COMMAND TO
02:07:06   DELETE THE CUBE WHEN I PRESS THE SHORTCUT TO
02:07:10   DELETE EARLIER, IT LOCKED THAT, AND THEN I'M
02:07:12   GOING TO CREATE A CUBE THAT'S SLIGHTLY LARGER
02:07:17   WITH THE RADIUS OF FIVE AND THAT WAS THE RADIUS
02:07:22   WAS DISPLAYED IN THE LOG BEFORE.
02:07:34   THE WINDOW I CLOSED BEFORE WAS A TEXT EDITOR.
02:07:38   BLENDER SHIPS WITH A RATHER SIMPLE TEXT EDITOR
02:07:41   THAT CAN LOAD AND RUN SCRIPTS.
02:07:44   YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THIS, YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN
02:07:47   TEXT EDITOR OF CHOICE AND THEN JUST LOAD YOUR
02:07:50   PYTHON SCRIPTS IN HERE.
02:07:53   SO I DO IMPORT BPI WHICH WILL IMPORT THE MODULE
02:07:59   AND I CALL THE SAME FUNCTION AS BEFORE TO CREATE
02:08:04   THE CUBE.
02:08:05   SINCE I'M IN A TEXT EDITOR, NOW I CAN DO COOLER,
02:08:10   MORE ADVANCED STUFF, LIKE LET'S SAY I WANT TO
02:08:13   MAKE A ROW OF CUBES, SO I AM GOING TO CREATE A
02:08:19   ROW OF CUBES AND I'M GOING TO MOVE THEM SLIGHTLY
02:08:32   BY SETTING THEIR X LOCATION.
02:08:33   SO I'M GOING TO RUN SCRIPT AND IT WILL CREATE FOR
02:08:42   ME A ROW OF CUBES.
02:08:43   YOU CAN SAVE THE SCRIPT AND BLENDER WILL ACTUALLY
02:08:55   SAVE A COPY OF THE SCRIPT WITHIN THE STOP BLEND
02:08:59   FILE AND IF EVER THE SCRIPT IS OUT OF SYNC WITH A
02:09:01   SCRIPT THAT, LET'S SAY, YOU FLOATED, BLENDER WILL
02:09:04   WARN YOU THAT THEY'RE OUT OF SYNC AND PROMPT YOU
02:09:08   TO RESYNC THEM.
02:09:09   SO WHILE CUBES ARE FUN, LET'S MAKE SOMETHING MORE
02:09:13   INTERESTING.
02:09:13   LET'S MAKE GLASSES.
02:09:16   SO HERE I'VE -- I WANTED TO TAKE AN IMAGE OF THE
02:09:22   FRONT OF A PAIR OF CLASSES FRAMES AND TURN IT
02:09:25   INTO A 3D PRINTABLE MODEL.
02:09:27   I WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE IT
02:09:30   EASIER TO PROTOTYPE A LOT OF DIFFERENT STYLE OF
02:09:34   GLASSES FRAMES FASTER.
02:09:35   SO I WROTE THIS SCRIPT THAT TAKES AN SVG OR IMAGE
02:09:45   VECTOR FILE OF A PAIR OF GLASSES, GOING TO HIT
02:09:49   "RUN," AND IT WILL ACT ON THAT IMAGE AND TURN IT
02:09:56   INTO A PAIR OF GLASSES FRAMES THAT I CAN PRINT.
02:10:01   HAS COOL LITTLE FEATURES, LIKE HAS NOSE PADS AND
02:10:05   IT HAS THE BRIDGE IN THE FRONT.
02:10:08   THAT'S A LITTLE BIT PROTRUDED.
02:10:11   SO SINCE I WANTED TO PROTOTYPE GLASSES THIS WAY,
02:10:18   I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GLASSES I'VE
02:10:21   GENERATED ARE ACTUALLY GOOD ENOUGH AND -- OR,
02:10:25   RATHER, THEY'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO ACTUAL GLASSES SO
02:10:28   THAT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY OFF FROM WHAT YOU'RE
02:10:33   INTENDING ON TO DESIGN VERSUS WHERE YOU'RE END
02:10:36   PRODUCT IS.
02:10:37   SO HERE I TOOK THE FRONT IMAGE OF A PAIR OF
02:10:46   GLASSES I ALREADY OWNED.
02:10:47   I RAN THAT IMAGE THROUGH MY SCRIPT TO GET A
02:10:55   3D-PRINTABLE FRAME, I RAN THAT OUT AND POPPED THE
02:10:58   LENSES OUT OF MY ORIGINAL PAIR OF GLASSES AND
02:11:00   POPPED IT INTO THIS PAIR THAT I 3D PRINTED, AND
02:11:08   IF THE LENS FITS, I WILL KNOW I -- THAT I GOT A
02:11:13   CLOSE ENOUGH PROXIMATE GENERATED FROM SINGLE
02:11:18   FRONT IMAGE, SO HERE'S ME POPPING THE LENSES
02:11:27   INTO... THE PAIR OF GLASSES.
02:11:30   LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW YOU DO THIS USING THE
02:11:49   API.
02:11:49   THESE ARE LIKE THE VERY BEGINNING STEPS TO HOW TO
02:11:52   GET STARTED MAKING YOUR OWN GLASSES.
02:11:54   SO FIRST I IMPORT AND SVG VECTOR IMAGE, A 2D
02:12:02   IMAGE, I'M GOING TO SCALE IT UP SO IT'S BIGGER
02:12:06   AND THEN EXTRUDE IT SO IT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF
02:12:08   THICKNESS TO IT.
02:12:09   SO HERE IS MY BLENDER APPLICATION, GOING TO
02:12:15   IMPORT PAIR OF GLASSES.
02:12:19   IT'S VERY SMALL WHEN YOU FIRST IMPORT IT BUT IF
02:12:22   YOU ZOOM IN, YOU CAN SEE IT.
02:12:24   NOW, I'M GOING TO HOVER OVER WHAT I WOULD HAVE
02:12:28   CLICKED IF I WAS DOING THIS VIA THE U.I., BUT
02:12:31   INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO CALL IT API -- CALL ITS API
02:12:38   EQUIVALENT TO SCALE IT UP.
02:12:40   I'M DOING TO SCALE IT UP APPROXIMATELY TEN TIME
02:12:47   ITS ORIGINAL SIZE, JUST TO WORK WITH IT A LITTLE
02:12:50   BIT EASIER.
02:12:52   NEXT I'M GOING TO EXTRUDE IT AND EXTRUDE WHICH
02:13:04   JUST MEANS IT WILL GIVE IT SOME THICKNESS SO
02:13:06   INSTEAD OF A 2D FLAT IMAGE, IT'S GOING TO BECOME
02:13:11   A 3D FIGURE.
02:13:12   SO I HOVER OVER WHERE I WOULD HAVE TYPED IN A
02:13:17   VALUE TO EXTRUDE IT AND, INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO
02:13:21   CALL THE EXTRUDE FROM THE CONSOLE.
02:13:26   SO NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THICKNESS.
02:13:33   IT'S PROBABLY RATHER HARD TO SEE ON HERE SO I'M
02:13:35   GOING TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF THIS CURRENTLY BLACK
02:13:41   PAIR OF FRAMES TO SOMETHING MORE VISIBLE.
02:13:48   SO I'M GOING TO CHANGE IT TO A BRIGHT PURPLE
02:13:59   COLOR JUST SO YOU CAN SEE IT EASIER AND WORK WITH
02:14:01   IT EASIER.
02:14:02   SO THERE'S YOUR GLASSES.
02:14:09   INSTEAD OF TYPING ALL THOSE IN THE CONSOLE, I
02:14:19   COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY HAVE WRITTEN ALL THOSE
02:14:20   IN A SINGLE PYTHON SCRIPT AND THEN HIT "RUN," AND
02:14:24   IN A SINGLE CLICK, IT'S GOING TO DO THE EXACT
02:14:27   SAME THING BY TURNING THE PICTURE INTO A PAIR OF
02:14:33   GLASSES.
02:14:36   THERE IS A LOT MORE STEPS I DID IN MY OWN SCRIPT
02:14:39   BUT THIS IS THE VERY BEGINNING STEPS ON HOW TO
02:14:44   MAKE YOUR OWN GLASSES.
02:14:45   LET'S BACK UP AND TALK ABOUT THE HIGH LEVEL
02:14:59   THINGS THAT I DID.
02:15:00   YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED I TYPED IN BPI DATA A LOT
02:15:04   AND THIS IS BLENDER'S WAY FOR YOU TO INTERACT
02:15:07   WITH THE DATA OBJECTS THAT BLENDER PROVIDES, SO
02:15:10   IF I WANT TO SAY CHANGE VERTEX, THEN THE DOTS
02:15:17   THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT REPRESENT
02:15:19   POINTS IN 3D SPACE, I CAN GO IN TO DATA, I CAN
02:15:22   CHECK IT THERE, I CAN GRAB THE COORDINATES AND
02:15:27   MOVE THEM AROUND.
02:15:28   YOU MIGHT HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT I TYPED BPI.OPS
02:15:34   A LOT.
02:15:35   BPI.OPS REPRESENT BLENDER'S OPERATORS.
02:15:41   ESSENTIALLY, EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE IN BLENDER IS
02:15:43   AN OPERATOR CALL AND OPERATORS ARE MODE
02:15:50   DEPENDENT.
02:15:51   SO BLENDER IS VERY MODAL, HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT
02:15:55   MODES.
02:15:55   ONE YOU PROBABLY ENCOUNTER THE MOST ARE THE
02:15:57   OBJECT MODE AND EDIT MODE AND OBJECT MODE DEALS
02:16:01   WITH THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO THE OBJECT AS A WHOLE
02:16:04   AND EDIT MODE TEND TO DEAL WITH FINER DETAILS OR
02:16:08   SUBCOMPONENTS OF THE MODEL, SO WHEN YOU INVOKE AN
02:16:14   OPERATOR CALL, THE CALL ITSELF WILL DO INTERNAL
02:16:20   POLL TO CHECK THE STATE OF THE APPLICATION TO SEE
02:16:24   WHAT MODE THEY'RE IN.
02:16:25   AND IF IT'S NOT IN EXPECTED MODE, IT WILL FAIL
02:16:31   AND THROW AN EXCEPTION.
02:16:32   OTHERWISE IT WILL EXECUTE ITS COMMANDS.
02:16:38   SO SOME MODE -- SOME OPERATORS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE
02:16:42   IN OBJECT MODE AND ON THES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN
02:16:44   EDIT MODE, SO EXAMPLE OF OPERATOR, WE USED WAS
02:16:51   SCALE.
02:16:52   SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REPRESENTATION.
02:17:01   WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO GET STARTED
02:17:03   MODELING IN BLENDER WITH THE API.
02:17:05   WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT BPI.DATA AND
02:17:10   BPI.OPS MEANT.
02:17:13   NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MODEL WITH
02:17:17   3D PRINTING CONSTRAINTS IN MIND.
02:17:18   SO YOU CAN'T PRINT EVERY 3D OBJECT YOU CAN THINK
02:17:23   OF.
02:17:24   THERE IS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS YOU
02:17:26   NEED TO KEEP IN MIND.
02:17:27   ONE IS YOUR OBJECT HAS TO BE MANIFOLD AND THIS
02:17:32   HAS A VERY MATHEMATICAL DEFINITION BUT YOU CAN
02:17:35   THINK OF IT AS YOUR OBJECT NEEDS TO BE WATERTIGHT
02:17:39   OR HAS NO HOLES IN ITS SURFACE, OR ROUGHLY THAT
02:17:44   EVERY EDGE NEEDS TO HAVE TWO FACES.
02:17:46   IF IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THIS CONSTRAINT, A LOT OF
02:17:54   SUBSEQUENT PROCESSES DOWNSTREAM WON'T KNOW HOW TO
02:17:57   HANDLE THE MODEL THAT YOU HAVE.
02:17:59   SO THAT'S ONE CONSTRAINT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN
02:18:04   MIND.
02:18:04   SECOND ONE IS YOUR NORMALS NEEDS TO FACE
02:18:09   OUTWARDS.
02:18:10   REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT NORMALS ON THE
02:18:11   BOTTOM OF THE CUBE?
02:18:13   SO BASICALLY, WHAT THIS MEANS IS, YOUR OUTSIDE --
02:18:18   THE OUTSIDEDNESS OF YOUR FACES NEED TO BE ON THE
02:18:21   OUTSIDE OF YOUR MODEL.
02:18:24   IF, LIKE, LET'S SAY ONE OF THEM'S FLIPPED, THAT'S
02:18:27   NO GOOD.
02:18:27   AND LASTLY, ANOTHER CONSTRAINT TO THINK ABOUT IS
02:18:33   YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY VERTICES, SO WHEN WE ARE
02:18:39   LOOKING AT THE CUBE BEFORE, WE SORT OF
02:18:41   REPRESENTED TWO CORNERS OF CUBE AS TWO VERTICES
02:18:46   WITH AN EDGE IN-BETWEEN.
02:18:50   WE COULD HAVE EASILY JUST AS WELL REPRESENTED
02:18:52   THAT EDGE AS HAVING, LET'S SAY, 10,000 VERTICES
02:18:56   IN-BETWEEN, CONNECTED BY VERY, VERY RARE TINY
02:19:00   EDGES AND THAT'S A TOTALLY LEGITIMATE
02:19:03   REPRESENTATION BUT BECAUSE OF SUDDENLY THERE'S A
02:19:07   LOT MORE VERTICES, GOING TO SLOW DOWN ANY POST
01:32:18   YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THAT AWAY BECAUSE YOU
01:32:20   ASKED FOR A 15 GIGABIT MOVIE FILE SO YOU CAN SEND
01:32:24   A VERY SHORT MESSAGE THAT SAYS I DON'T NEEDS THIS
01:32:26   ANYMORE AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY USEFUL WITH
01:32:28   SERVER PUSH.
01:32:29   SERVER PUSH IS KIND OF THE BIGGEST HEADLINE
01:32:32   FEATURE, NOT ACTUALLY THAT WIDELY USED AND
01:32:34   PROBABLY WON'T BE, BUT THE SERVER CAN SEND YOU
01:32:36   RESPONSES TO REQUESTS IT THINKS YOU WILL MAKE AND
01:32:41   THIS IS NOT SOME FORM OF PSYCHIC WIZARDRY, THINGS
01:32:44   TO DO WITH THE SERVER KNOWS THE HTML PAGE CALLS
01:32:48   IN THE FIVE SERVER DOCUMENTS, SO YOU'RE GOING TO
01:32:50   ASK FOR THEM.
01:32:50   IT WILL SEND ITS RESPONSE IN ADVANCE.
01:32:53   THIS IS ONLY FOR PRIME CATCHES, THE ONLY
           PROCESSING THAT HAPPENS.
02:19:13   AND ALSO THE -- SOME OF THE POST-PROCESSING
01:32:18   YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THAT AWAY BECAUSE YOU
01:32:20   ASKED FOR A 15 GIGABIT MOVIE FILE SO YOU CAN SEND

01:32:53   THIS IS ONLY FOR PRIME CATCHES, THE ONLY SOFTWARE
02:19:21   WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE LIKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
02:19:24   VE
01:32:18   YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW THAT AWAY BECAUSE YOU
01:32:20   ASKED FOR A 15 GIGABIT MOVIE FILE SO YOU CAN SEND

01:32:50   ASK FOR THEM.
01:32:50   IT WILL SEND ITS RESPONSE IN ADVANCE.
01:32:53   THIS IS ONLY FOR PRIME CATCHES, THE ONLY ER AT
02:19:25   THE SEES AND THIS IS VERY -- THIS ASPECT IS --
02:19:29   THIS CONSTRAINT IS VERY PRINTER SPECIFIC AND MAY
02:19:40   BE MODEL SPECIFIC, DEPENDING ON HOW TO SEND THE
02:19:44   INFORMATION TO YOUR PRINTER.
02:19:46   A MORE VISUAL IS THE DOUGHNUT OR TAURUS THAT YOU
02:20:00   SEE ON YOUR RIGHT, THAT'S TOTALLY AVAILABLE TO BE
02:20:06   3D PRINTED, EVEN THOUGH YOU SEE THAT GAPING HOLE
02:20:09   IN THE MIDDLE.
02:20:11   IT'S NOT A HOLE IN THE SURFACE OF THE MODEL WHICH
02:20:13   IS KEY, WHEREAS THE ONE YOU SEE ON THE LEFT,
02:20:19   THERE'S THIS DARK RECTANGLE AREA AND THAT
02:20:25   REPRESENTS THERE'S MISSING FACES THERE, SO THE
02:20:29   EDGES ONLY HAVE ONE FACE ON ONE SIDE AND THERE'S
02:20:33   JUST NOTHING ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THAT'S NOT A
02:20:38   GOOD MODEL.
02:20:40   SO BLENDER PROVIDES YOU WITH A LOT OF OPERATORS
02:20:48   TO HELP YOU FIX YOUR MODEL SHOULD YOU NEED HELP
02:20:50   FIXING.
02:20:51   YOU COULD USE FILL OR FILL HOLES TO FILL THE
02:20:57   MISSING COMPONENT, MISSING FACES.
02:21:00   YOU COULD USE -- MAKE OUTWARD NORMAL CONSISTENT,
02:21:07   SO YOU CAN USE THIS FUNCTION TO SORT OF PUT ALL
02:21:11   THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR FACES ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR
02:21:15   MODEL SORT OF DEFINE THE OUTSIDE AS THE OUTSIDE.
02:21:20   ALSO, YOU COULD USE A DECIMATION MODIFIER TO TRY
02:21:24   TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VERTICES WITHOUT USING
02:21:27   RESOLUTION.
02:21:28   WHEN YOU FIRST START 3D PRINTING, THERE'S A LOT
02:21:35   OF TOOLS OUT THERE THAT WILL SORT OF FIX YOUR
02:21:37   MODELS FOR YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
02:21:41   YOURSELF BUT THIS IS USEFUL, LIKE, BEING ABLE TO
02:21:45   FIX IT YOURSELF IS USEFUL WHEN THOSE TOOLS DON'T
02:21:49   WORK.
02:21:50   SO HAVE THIS LITTLE FIGURINE I MADE MAYBE TWO
02:21:54   YEARS AGO, AND AT THE TIME, I TRIED TO -- I
02:21:58   DIDN'T USE THIS -- DIDN'T MAKE THIS IN BLENDER
02:22:01   BUT I TRIED TO USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOFTWARE TO
02:22:05   HELP ME PRINT THIS LITTLE FIGURINE AND NONE OF
02:22:08   THEM WORKED.
02:22:09   ALMOST NONE OF THEM.
02:22:11   SO I TRIED USING NETFAB AT THE TIME, WHICH IS A
02:22:16   POPULAR MESH REPAIR TOOL THAT'S SPECIFICALLY
02:22:19   DEDICATED TO REPAIRING MODELS FOR 3D PRINTING AND
02:22:22   THAT FAILED.
02:22:23   I THINK ADOBE PHOTO SHOP WAS COMING OUT WITH 3D
02:22:27   PRINTING SUPPORT AT THE TIME AND THAT DIDN'T FIX
02:22:30   IT.
02:22:30   I TRIED USING MESH MIXER AT THE TIME, THAT DIDN'T
02:22:34   WORK, EITHER.
02:22:35   WHAT WORKED WAS AUTO DESK PRINT UTILITY WHICH IS
02:22:38   A SOFTWARE TO ALSO HELP YOU 3D PRINT BY AUTO
02:22:41   DESK, BUT IT TOOK THREE HOURS TO RUN ON MY
02:22:44   LAPTOP, TO SORT OF FIX THIS SMALL MODEL AND THERE
02:22:49   WAS A LOT OF LOSS IN RESOLUTION WHICH I DIDN'T
02:22:55   LIKE.
02:22:55   SO, MORE RECENTLY I DECIDED, HEY, LET ME TRY
02:22:58   WRITING MY OWN CLEAN-UP PROTOCOL SO I WENT INTO
02:23:01   BLENDER, SCRIPTED SOME INSTRUCTIONS TO HOW I
02:23:04   WOULD WANT MY MODEL TO BE FIXED AND IT RAN IN
02:23:09   ABOUT FIVE MINUTE AND PRODUCED A COMPLETELY
02:23:10   PRINTABLE MODEL.
02:23:12   SO THAT'S THE POWER OF BEING ABLE TO WRITE YOUR
02:23:15   OWN CLEAN-UP PROTOCOL.
02:23:17   SO WE'VE COVERED A LOT IN THE PAST 30 MINUTES.
02:23:26   WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS 3D PRINTING, HOW 3D
02:23:30   MODELS ARE REPRESENTED.
02:23:32   WE TALKED ABOUT THE BLENDER API, HOW TO SET UP --
02:23:38   HOW TO SET UP SCRIPTING, DIFFERENT WAYS OF
02:23:41   MODELING WITH THE OPERATORS AND 3D PRINTING
02:23:48   CONSTRAINTS.
02:23:50   I HOPE YOU'VE ALL LEARNED A LOT.
02:23:52   YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT AUDIENCE.
02:23:55   AND THANK YOU.
02:23:55   [ Applause ]
02:23:57   MAYBE WE HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS?
02:24:12   QUESTIONS.
02:24:13   I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS BUT
02:24:16   WE'LL TRY TO DO QUESTIONS.
02:24:18   >> AUDIENCE:  JUST A QUICK QUESTION, CAN YOU
02:24:19   RECOMMEND ANY ONLINE RESOURCES FOR THOSE WANTING
02:24:21   TO GET INTO FINDING OUT ABOUT BLENDER AND PYTHON?
02:24:26   >> THE QUESTION WAS -- CAN YOU REPEAT THE
02:24:28   QUESTION?
02:24:29   >> AUDIENCE:  SORRY.
02:24:29   CAN YOU RECOMMEND ANY ONLINE RESOURCES FOR
02:24:31   GETTING STARTED WITH PYTHON AND BLENDER?
02:24:37   >> YES.
02:24:38   THERE'S A LOT OF YOUTube VIDEOS.
02:24:42   I DON'T KNOW ANY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE
02:24:46   IS A WEALTH OF YOUTube VIDEOS FOR BASICALLY
02:24:51   ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO.
02:24:51   YOU CAN BE, LIKE, VERY SPECIFIC, LIKE I WANT TO
02:24:54   MAKE A HOUSE, HOW WOULD DO I THAT AND IT WILL TRY
02:24:58   TO LIKE -- PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN LIKE TONS AND TONS
02:25:00   OF TUTORIALS ABOUT THAT.
02:25:01   BUT, ALSO, FIND ME AFTERWARDS AND I'LL TRY TO
02:25:04   HELP YOU.
02:25:07   >> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU FOR THIS.
02:25:09   DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY IN
02:25:11   BLENDER TO ROUND EDGES?
02:25:14   >> ROUND THE EDGES.
02:25:17   YES, SO IT'S SORT OF DEPENDS ON -- OKAY.
02:25:24   SO THE SIMPLE SOLUTION, YES, THERE IS A MODIFIER,
02:25:27   IT WILL, LIKE, TRY TO SMOOTH YOUR EDGES FOR YOU
02:25:31   BUT THE WAY IT DOES THAT IS IT SORT OF CREATES
02:25:35   MORE AND MORE EDGES FOR YOU SO TO, LIKE, ROUND IT
02:25:38   OUT AND IF YOU DO THAT, LIKE, LIKE A LOT OF
02:25:42   TIMES, YOU'RE GOING TO GET TONS OF VERTICES, BUT
02:25:46   THAT IS A VERY EASY WAY TO MAKE -- THERE IS A
02:25:49   SMOOTHING FUNCTION IN BLENDER TO TRY TO SMOOTH
02:25:52   OUT YOUR OBJECTS.
02:25:53   >> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU.
02:25:56   >> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.
02:25:57   I HAD A QUESTION ON THE SVG FILE.
02:26:00   CURRENTLY WORK FOR A SCHOOL AND WE HAVE A LOT OF
02:26:03   PROBLEMS TRYING TO ACTUALLY EITHER LASER SCAN
02:26:06   OBJECTS OR PHOTO GRAB THEM AND IMPORT THEM.
02:26:10   WHAT ARE YOU DOING BECAUSE WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS
02:26:12   MAKING, YOU KNOW, THE STL FILES MANUALLY IN
02:26:15   BLENDER OR MAKER BOT BUT HOW ARE YOU ACTUALLY
02:26:20   ACQUIRING CERTAIN IMAGES?
02:26:22   >> THE WAY I MAKE SVG FILES IS I USE INK SCAPE,
02:26:26   ANOTHER OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.
02:26:28   >> AUDIENCE: OKAY.
02:26:28   >> AND INK SCAPE, YOU CAN PASS IT IN LIKE ROSTER
02:26:34   IMAGE, LIKE A JPEG OR PINK, AND YOU CAN SAY
02:26:38   "TRACE OUTLINE" AND IT WILL DO ITS BEST TO TRACE
02:26:42   ITS OUTLINE AND TURN IT INTO A VECTOR IMAGE.
02:26:46   >> AUDIENCE:  THANK YOU.
02:26:48   >> AUDIENCE:  HEY.
02:26:49   THANKS FOR THE TALK.
02:26:49   THERE WAS SUPER COOL.
02:26:51   I WAS WONDERING, I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE -- I
02:26:55   SUPPOSE ITS MAKES SENSE BUT DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE
02:26:56   THAT PEOPLE WERE USING BLENDER FOR 3D PRINTING.
02:27:00   I WAS WONDERING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO, LIKE -- I
02:27:02   FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN STUFF ABOUT FILLING OBJECTS
02:27:05   IN DIFFERENT WAYS, LIKE THERE'S DIFFERENT
02:27:08   STRATEGIES FOR FILLING THE INTERNALS OF THESE
02:27:10   OBJECTS, LIKE DOES BLENDER HAVE SOMETHING THAT
02:27:12   DEALS WITH THAT OR...
02:27:18   OR IS IT JUST ASSUMED TO BE SOLID AND THAT'S THE
02:27:21   END OF IT?
02:27:22   >> SO, IT DEPEND -- SO IF YOU'RE PRINTING -- I'M
02:27:26   TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION.
02:27:27   YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FILLING --
02:27:31   >> AUDIENCE:  SO IF YOU HAVE A SQUARE, INSIDE
02:27:34   THE -- THOSE FACES, DO YOU GET TO SAY, THIS
02:27:39   SHOULD BE JUST FULL OF SOLID PLASTIC OR DO YOU
02:27:43   JUST SAY IT'S EMPTY?
02:27:44   >> IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'RE PRINTING IT SO IF YOU
02:27:47   HAVE LIKE A SQUARE, IT'S JUST THESE SETS OF
02:27:49   FACES.
02:27:50   WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY PRINTING, IF YOU HAVE YOUR
02:27:52   OWN PRINTER, YOU CAN SPECIFY LIKE A FILL TYPE SO
02:27:56   YOU CAN SAY, LIKE, I WANT A HONEYCOMB PATTERN AND
02:27:59   YOUR PRINTER IS GOING TO TRY TO FILL IT IN A
02:28:02   HONEYCOMB PATTERN.
02:28:03   IF YOU'RE NOT PRINTING IT YOURSELF AND EXPORTING
02:28:06   IT TO SOMEONE ELSE TO PRINT, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO,
02:28:09   LIKE, SORT OF GENERATE WHAT THE INTERNALS WOULD
02:28:12   LOOK LIKE BEFORE YOU EXPORT THIS MODEL.
02:28:16   >> AUDIENCE:  SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BLENDER
02:28:18   THING, IT MIGHT BE A PREVENTER DRIVER DEAL, IS
02:28:20   THAT --
02:28:21   >> SPECIFYING THE FILL OF IT IS MORE ON THE
02:28:25   PRINTER SIDE OF THE JOB BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY
02:28:30   MODEL IT TO SAY, I WANT A SOLID FILL AND I WANT
02:28:37   IT TO BE FILLED THIS WAY BY ACTUALLY GENERATING
02:28:39   WHAT THE INTERNALS WOULD LOOK LIKE.
02:28:41   >> AUDIENCE:  OKAY.
02:28:42   EXCELLENT.
02:28:42   THANKS A LOT.
02:28:43   >> THANK YOU.
