16:09:46  >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.
16:09:47  HI.  MY NAME IS JOE, ONE OF THE SESSION
16:09:49  CHAIRS HERE.
16:09:50  AND IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE JEFF
16:09:53  SCHENCK TO YOU.
16:09:53  HE IS A CTO AS SAN FRANCISCO BASED CHEWSE,
16:09:59  WHICH IS AN OFFICE CATERING COMPANY.
16:10:01  HE HAS A LOT OF THINGS TO SAY TO YOU ABOUT
16:10:04  REST TODAY.
16:10:05  SO PLEASE ENJOY THE TALK, AND HAVE A GREAT
16:10:07  TIME.
16:10:08  [ APPLAUSE ]
16:10:08  >> HELLO.
16:10:14  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
16:10:16  I HOPE YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE.
16:10:20  I HOPE IT BUILDS ON THE LAST TALK.
16:10:23  UNFORTUNATELY I WASN'T ABLE TO SEE IT.
16:10:24  I KNOW IT WAS ALSO ABOUT REST SO I HOPE THIS
16:10:28  ISN'T REDUNDANT.
16:10:29  I HOPE IT'S ADDITIVE AND EXCITING.
16:10:32  I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE REST
16:10:39  THE WAY THAT WEB DEVELOPMENT IS STARTING TO
16:10:42  SHIFT.
16:10:36  ASCENDANCY OR WHAT IS BASICALLY IN MY MIND
16:10:43  I'M SORT OF SEEING THIS SHIFT.
16:10:45  I THINK A LOT OF US ARE WITH JAVASCRIPT
16:10:49  TAKING A BIGGER AND BIGGER ROLE, AND WHAT
16:10:51  THAT DOES TO THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD
16:10:54  WEBSITES OUT OF AND HOW OUR TOOLS, I THINK,
16:10:57  NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK TO KIND OF
16:10:59  KEEP UP WITH WEB DEVELOPMENT.
16:11:02  SO AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK
16:11:06  ABOUT.
16:11:06  FIRST I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHY THAT'S THE
16:11:09  CASE.
16:11:09  WHAT ARE THESE BIG TECTONIC SHIFTS THAT ARE
16:11:12  LEADING US INTO THIS WORLD.
16:11:14  TWO, I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE
16:11:16  STATE TODAY OF REST.
16:11:17  WHAT REST TOOLS DO WE HAVE.
16:11:20  AND HOW DO THEY BASICALLY WORK, BECAUSE FOR
16:11:23  ALL THE BASICS, THEY WORK GREAT, SO I'LL SHOW
16:11:26  YOU.
16:11:27  THEN I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT AT LEAST WHAT MY
16:11:29  PINPOINTS ARE.
16:11:30  AND I'VE CORROBORATED THESE WITH A LOT OF
16:11:35  WHAT ARE THESE PINPOINTS THAT WE'RE STARTING
16:11:38  TO SEE GIVEN THESE SHIFTS IN THE WAY WEB
16:11:32  OTHER PEOPLE, SO I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST ME.
16:11:41  DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS AND THEN HOW ARE WE GOING
16:11:43  TO FIX THESE, HOW ARE WE GOING TO HELP OUR
16:11:45  TOOLS HELP US, WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE THE
16:11:49  FUTURE A BETTER PLACE FOR PYTHON AND FOR THE
16:11:52  WEB SO I CAN KEEP PROGRAMMING PYTHON FOR THE
16:11:55  WEB WHICH IS SOMETHING I REALLY ENJOY DOING.
16:11:58  SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY REST AND REST APIS
16:12:01  ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS.
16:12:03  AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS THESE GUYS.
16:12:05  ANGULAR, BACKBONE, EMBER, SOME OF THESE VERY
16:12:09  HEAVY, VERY BIG FRONT END FRAMEWORKS ARE
16:12:13  STARTING TO TAKE SOME OF THE LOAD FROM WHAT
16:12:17  WE TRADITIONALLY USED TO DO AS WEB
16:12:20  DEVELOPERS, WHICH IS ALL ON THE BACK END.
16:12:22  SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT KIND OF THE LONGER
16:12:25  ANSWER, THE FRONT END CODE HAS ALWAYS BEEN,
16:12:29  YOU KNOW, TRADITIONALLY DISPLAY LOGIC,
16:12:32  INTERACTIONS, AND THE BACK END WAS YOUR
16:12:34  APPLICATION LOGIC, DATABASE, CACHE, OTHER
16:12:37  SERVICES, AT A VERY ROUGH LEVEL.
16:12:40  THAT'S KIND OF THE BREAKDOWN WE'VE HAD.
16:12:41  AND THE WAY WE TALKED BETWEEN THEM WAS HTML
16:12:49  SOME OF THESE OTHER GOOD TOOLS THAT WE HAVE.
16:12:51  AND THAT WORKED PRETTY WELL FOR A WHILE.
16:12:45  ALONG WITH, YOU KNOW, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT AND
16:12:54  AND THEN WE WANTED TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE ON
16:12:56  THE FRONT END.
16:12:56  WE WANTED THINGS TO BE REALLY RESPONSIVE.
16:12:58  WE WANTED PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE TO WAIT FOR A
16:13:01  WHOLE PAGE TO LOAD, AND WE KIND OF JAMMED IN
16:13:04  THIS AJAX THING, AND, YOU KNOW, GENERALLY, AT
16:13:06  FIRST IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THESE ONE-OFF AJAX
16:13:09  THINGS THAT YOU WOULD WRITE IN J QUERY.
16:13:11  AND, YOU KNOW, I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN ON THE
16:13:13  SERVER, AND THEN IT WOULD RESPOND, AND IT WAS
16:13:15  ALL KIND OF A ONE-OFF HACKY MESS FOR MOST
16:13:18  APPLICATIONS AT THE TIME.
16:13:20  AND THAT HELD US OVER FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
16:13:22  BUT WITH ANGULAR AND BACKBONE AND EMBER AND
16:13:26  THESE GUYS, WHAT I SEE IS A PRETTY
16:13:28  FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT TO WHERE THE FRONT END HAS
16:13:31  NOW TAKEN OVER A BIG CHUNK OF WHAT USED TO BE
16:13:35  DONE ON THE BACK END, THIS APPLICATION LOGIC.
16:13:38  AND SO NOW YOU'RE SEEING APPLICATION LOGIC
16:13:40  HAPPEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION.
16:13:43  AND WE NEEDED SOMETHING NEW.
16:13:47  BECAUSE YOU'RE NOW DOING APPLICATION LOGIC IN
16:13:53  FRONT END.
16:13:54  THE FRONT END NEEDED A WAY TO TALK TO THESE
16:13:50  A MUCH BIGGER, MORE SUBSTANTIAL WAY ON THE
16:13:57  SERVICES THAT YOU HAVE TRADITIONALLY ON THE
16:14:00  BACK END ON KIND OF A MUCH MORE LOW LEVEL
16:14:03  SYSTEM, YOU KNOW, GET CLOSER TO THE RAW DATA.
16:14:07  AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?
16:14:10  REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER, WHICH IF YOU
16:14:13  DIDN'T KNOW IS WHAT REST STANDS FOR.
16:14:17  SO REST GIVES YOU A REALLY EASY AND SIMPLE
16:14:20  WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR DATA.
16:14:23  USUALLY IN A DATABASE, BUT ANY OTHER
16:14:26  DATASTORE IS FINE.
16:14:28  AND LIKE I SAID, THIS HELPS A LOT WHEN YOU'RE
16:14:29  DOING ALL THIS APPLICATION LOGIC IN THE FRONT
16:14:32  END.
16:14:33  COOL.
16:14:34  SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE REST IS AND WHERE
16:14:38  OUR TOOLS ARE FOR BUILDING THESE REST APIS
16:14:42  THAT UNDERPIN SOME OF THESE NEW FRONT END
16:14:45  TECHNOLOGIES.
16:14:48  SO AS YOU ALL KNOW, GOOGLE TRENDS IS THE
16:14:51  CANONICAL SOURCE FOR ANYTHING LIKE THIS,
16:14:53  TOTALLY, TOTALLY MAKES A -- OKAY.
16:14:55  SO YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPEN
16:15:02  FRAMEWORK HAS COMPLETELY BROKEN AWAY FROM
16:15:05  EVERYTHING ELSE, AND THAT INCLUDES
16:14:58  OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS DJANGO REST
16:15:07  FLASK-RESTFUL, DJANGO TASTYPIE.
16:15:12  DJANGO [INAUDIBLE] IS DEAD.
16:15:15  DON'T USE IT.
16:15:16  THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD THINGS TO USE FROM THESE
16:15:18  TOOLS.
16:15:18  THERE SEEMS TO BE A TON OF MOMENTUM IN THE
16:15:20  COMMUNITY AROUND DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK.
16:15:24  SO THAT'S -- I HOPE I'M NOT DISAPPOINTING
16:15:27  ANYONE.
16:15:28  A LOT OF MY EXAMPLES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE
16:15:30  CONTEXT OF DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK.
16:15:35  BUT A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS I'M GOING TO TALK
16:15:37  ABOUT APPLY EQUALLY WELL TO THE OTHER
16:15:40  FRAMEWORKS THAT WE HAVE.
16:15:42  AND FOR A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT, DJANGO REST
16:15:45  FRAMEWORK HAD A KICKSTARTER JUST A FEW MONTHS
16:15:47  AGO, I BELIEVE, TO DO KICKSTARTER 3.0 --
16:15:52  SORRY-- REST FRAMEWORK 3.0, WHICH INCLUDED
16:15:55  SOME SERIALIZERS, NESTED RIGHTS, AND BETTER
16:15:59  VALIDATION.
16:16:01  HE HAD TO HIT 800% OF ITS FUND-RAISING GOAL,
16:16:06  WHICH IS 32,000 POUNDS, AND I HAVE NO IDEA
16:16:12  MONEY.
16:16:13  SO THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS TOOL.
16:16:08  HOW MANY CANADIAN DOLLARS THAT IS, BUT GOOD
16:16:15  SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF WHAT DJANGO
16:16:18  REST FRAMEWORK WOULD DO WITH A REST API AND
16:16:21  WHAT A REALLY BASIC REST API LOOKS LIKE SO
16:16:25  THAT WE CAN BUILD ON TOP OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
16:16:26  AND START TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES.
16:16:29  SO SERIALIZERS.
16:16:30  THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHEN
16:16:32  YOU'RE DOING A REST API IS SERIALIZATION AND
16:16:36  DESERIALIZATION.
16:16:38  YOU HAVE THIS DATA WHICH IS, SAY, IN THE
16:16:40  DATABASE.
16:16:40  AND YOU NEED TO PULL IT OUT AND REPRESENT IT
16:16:43  AS SOMETHING THAT CAN THEN BE SENT OVER THE
16:16:45  WIRE BY YOUR API AND CONSUMED BY A JAVASCRIPT
16:16:51  FRAMEWORK.
16:16:51  SO IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE BACK AND
16:16:54  FORTH BETWEEN JSON, XML AND YOUR KIND OF
16:16:59  NATIVE PYTHON FORMATS.
16:17:01  ALL OF THE TOOLS, ALL OF THE REST APIS DO
16:17:05  THIS SUPER, SUPER WELL, IT'S KIND OF A CORE
16:17:07  COMPETENCY OF THESE THINGS.
16:17:09  YOU GET THAT MORE OR LESS FOR FREE.
16:17:14  A CAT, WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME.
16:17:19  THE NEXT THING YOU NEED IS VIEWS IN AT LEAST
16:17:11  YOU CAN SEE IT'S FOUR LINES HERE TO SERIALIZE
16:17:22  THE DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK WORLD.
16:17:25  BASICALLY, WHAT THIS DOES IS IT WIRES UP THE
16:17:27  ACTUAL DATA THAT YOU'RE ACCESSING AND THE
16:17:30  SERIALIZER THAT YOU'RE USING TO REPRESENT IT.
16:17:32  SO THIS IS AGAIN JUST THREE LINES, AND YOU
16:17:35  GET A LOT FOR FREE HERE.
16:17:37  SO YOU'RE TELLING IT WHICH CATS TO SERIALIZE
16:17:40  AND HOW TO SERIALIZE THEM WITH THE SERIALIZER
16:17:42  WE JUST DEFINED.
16:17:45  THEN THERE'S KIND OF A QUICK ONE-LINER TO
16:17:47  TURN THAT INTO A URL END POINT, AND SUDDENLY
16:17:50  YOU'VE GOT A REST API.
16:17:52  YOU CAN HIT THAT CAT END POINT AND GET A LIST
16:17:55  OF CATS, YOU CAN HIT THAT CAT END POINT AND
16:17:58  CREATE A NEW CAT, ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
16:18:00  SO YOU CAN SEE FOR THE REALLY SIMPLE STUFF
16:18:02  THIS WORKS SO, SO WELL.
16:18:03  IT'S REALLY VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO CREATE
16:18:06  THESE BASIC APIS, WHICH IS AWESOME.
16:18:09  I WANT TO TEASE ONE OF THE -- I'LL WARN YOU.
16:18:12  IT TURNED OUT THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF WHAT I
16:18:13  HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS NEW WORLD AND WHERE WE
16:18:20  PERMISSIONS.
16:18:21  AUTHENTICATION AND PERMISSIONS.
16:18:16  NEED TO TAKE REST FRAMEWORKS HAS TO DO WITH
16:18:22  AND SO I WANTED TO TEASE KIND OF WHAT DO
16:18:25  PERMISSIONS LOOK LIKE TODAY IN DJANGO REST
16:18:29  FRAMEWORK AT LEAST.
16:18:30  AND YOU KNOW, THE OTHER FRAMEWORKS HAVE --
16:18:33  THERE ARE DEFINITELY DIFFERENCES IN HOW THEY
16:18:35  REPRESENT THIS BUT ROUGHLY SIMILAR CONCEPTS.
16:18:37  AND BASICALLY, WE'VE GOT A PERMISSION
16:18:40  SUBCLASS THAT DEFINES HAS OBJECT PERMISSION
16:18:44  OR HAS PERMISSION.
16:18:46  AND THIS BASICALLY YOU CAN WRITE YOUR CUSTOM
16:18:48  LOGIC INSIDE OF THERE TO SAY BASED ON THIS
16:18:51  REQUEST I KNOW IT'S THIS PERSON.
16:18:53  THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS THING.
16:18:54  SO YES, NO, THEY DO OR DO NOT HAVE
16:18:56  PERMISSION.
16:18:58  AND THAT'S IT.
16:18:58  THEY WILL EITHER GET A 401 ACCESS DENIED OR
16:19:02  WHATEVER IT IS, OR THEY WILL GET THE OBJECT.
16:19:05  GREAT.
16:19:06  SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE
16:19:11  PINPOINTS THAT ARE INVOLVED.
16:19:15  SO LIKE I SAID, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BIG
16:19:22  DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN TRENDING OVER THE LAST
16:19:24  FEW YEARS, AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT KIND OF
16:19:19  TECTONIC SHIFTS I THINK IN THE WAY WEB
16:19:26  THE BIG TECTONIC SHIFTS THAT ARE AFFECTING
16:19:30  THE WAY APIS ARE BUILT.
16:19:32  THE FIRST IS TO THINK ABOUT WHO IS THE
16:19:33  CONSUMER OF YOUR API.
16:19:35  YOU KNOW, TRADITIONALLY, I THINK IF YOU GO
16:19:38  BACK, IT WAS VERY COMMON TO SEE
16:19:40  DEVELOPER-FACING APIS RIGHT AND YOU WANT
16:19:42  OTHER DEVELOPERS TO BE ABLE TO HACK ON YOUR
16:19:44  TOOL TO BE ABLE TO BUILD COOL STUFF ON TOP OF
16:19:46  YOUR THING AND LIKE MAKE THESE -- YOU KNOW,
16:19:49  COMPOSE THE FLOWS OF COOL STUFF AND THE
16:19:53  INTERNET WAS GOING TO BE GREAT.
16:19:54  AND IT'S STILL COOL, AND YOU CAN DO COOL
16:19:57  THINGS WITH DEVELOPER FACING APIS.  BUT I
16:19:59  THINK IT IS NOT ANY LONGER THE PRIMARY USE
16:20:01  CASE FOR BUILDING A REST API.
16:20:03  I THINK THE PRIMARY USE CASE FOR A LOT OF US
16:20:05  ANYWAY IS YOUR OWN APP.
16:20:10  YOU'RE WRITING THIS REST API FOR YOU TO USE
16:20:13  IN BUILDING YOUR OWN WEBSITE.
16:20:14  AND SURE, IT'S OPEN TO THE INTERNET BECAUSE
16:20:17  IT HAS TO BE, AND THEORETICALLY, SOMEONE
16:20:21  BUT IT'S NOT DOCUMENTED EXTERNALLY.
16:20:23  IT'S NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN AND WORK
16:20:19  COULD COME IN AND START USING IT.
16:20:26  ON IT.
16:20:31  IT'S MEANT TO BUILD YOUR APP ON TOP OF IT.
16:20:35  AND I THINK THIS CHANGE IN THE CONSUMER API
16:20:36  HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT
16:20:39  IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DO.
16:20:41  IT NEEDS TO BE SO MUCH BROADER IN SCOPE
16:20:43  BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
16:20:45  YOUR APP NEEDS TO TOUCH AND THINK ABOUT IT
16:20:47  AND WORK WITH IT'S BROADER THAN MOST OF THE
16:20:50  DEVELOPER APIS USED TO BE.
16:20:52  AND I THINK THE [INAUDIBLE] GET MORE COMPLEX
16:20:55  BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH DIFFERENT KINDS
16:20:57  OF USERS COMING FROM DIFFERENT KINDS OF
16:20:59  PLACES.
16:21:00  IT'S NOT QUITE AS ON RAILS AS A DEVELOPER API
16:21:03  EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE.
16:21:03  SO THE OTHER BIG TECTONIC SHIFTS I WANT TO
16:21:08  TALK ABOUT IS WHAT -- WELL, WHAT WE ALREADY
16:21:10  MENTIONED.
16:21:11  SO YOU REMEMBER THIS SHIFT FROM THE BACK END
16:21:13  AND THE FRONT END.
16:21:14  AND THE FRONT END NOW TAKING UP A PORTION OF
16:21:19  A GOOD CHUNK OF YOUR APPLICATION LOGIC IS NOW
16:21:21  BEING DONE IN THESE FRONT END [INAUDIBLE].
16:21:17  YOUR APPLICATION LOGIC.
16:21:25  I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT WAY TO
16:21:27  THINK ABOUT THIS SHIFT, WHICH IS YOU USED TO
16:21:30  HAVE UNTRUSTED AND TRUSTED, AND NOW YOU'VE
16:21:33  GOT APPLICATION LOGIC RUNNING IN AN UNTRUSTED
16:21:38  ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MUCH
16:21:39  OF THAT GOING ON BEFORE.
16:21:41  YOU KNOW, JAVASCRIPT RUNS IN THE BROWSER.
16:21:45  WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENS THERE.
16:21:46  WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THE CODE THAT'S
16:21:49  EXECUTING IS SECURE.
16:21:50  WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT WHAT WE WROTE IN
16:21:54  TERMS OF USING OUR API IS WHAT IS ACTUALLY
16:21:58  HAPPENING.
16:21:59  ANYONE COULD DO ANYTHING WITH THAT API, WHICH
16:22:02  MEANS IT'S MORE -- THE PERMISSIONS AND THE
16:22:04  AUTHENTICATIONS ARE MORE COMPLICATED THAN
16:22:06  THEY WERE, AND GETTING IT RIGHT IS MORE
16:22:08  IMPORTANT THAN IT EVER WAS.
16:22:12  SO I THINK THESE ARE THE KEY SHIFTS THAT HAVE
16:22:15  CAUSED KIND OF THIS EXTRA LAYER OF
16:22:18  COMPLICATION THAT WE NEED TO NOW SOLVE.
16:22:20  SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE KIND OF
16:22:24  PERMISSIONS NOW --
16:22:26  I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE KINDS
16:22:22  THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITH AUTHENTICATIONS AND
16:22:28  OF AUTHENTICATION JUST TO GIVE YOU AN
16:22:30  OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE TOOLS ARE, WHAT WE'RE
16:22:32  DEALING WITH HERE IN TERMS OF AUTHENTICATION
16:22:34  IN YOUR REST API.
16:22:36  YOU CAN DO SESSION BASED OFF -- WHICH
16:22:38  BASICALLY JUST PLUGS INTO IF YOU'RE USING
16:22:43  REGULAR SESSION BASED OFF IN YOUR REGULAR API
16:22:46  BEFORE A REST API.  YOU CAN KIND OF USE THAT
16:22:49  SAME SESSION BASED OFF.
16:22:50  IT'S A LITTLE BIT HACKY, BUT IT WORKS FAIRLY
16:22:52  WELL.
16:22:53  YOU CAN DO TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION.
16:22:57  THERE ARE THINGS CALLED JWTS, OR JOTS.
16:23:01  IT STANDS FOR JSON WEB TOKEN, AND IT'S
16:23:04  BASICALLY A SIGNED REPRESENTATION OF A CLAIM.
16:23:06  SO LIKE THIS PERSON CAN DO THIS THING WITH
16:23:09  THIS THING.
16:23:11  CAN BE KIND OF COMPACTLY REPRESENTED LIKE YOU
16:23:14  SEE THERE AND SENT BACK AND FORTH ALONG THE
16:23:17  WIRE.
16:23:17  IT'S A FORMAT THAT'S MEANT TO BE PASSED BACK
16:23:19  AND FORTH WITH EVERY REQUEST.
16:23:23  YOU'VE ALSO GOT SIGNED AUTHENTICATION.
16:23:26  SO YOU'VE GOT A URL, AND YOU JUST PLOP A
16:23:21  SO THAT'S AN OPTION.
16:23:28  SIGNATURE ON TOP OF IT TO SAY, YES, THIS
16:23:31  PERSON CAN DO THIS THING.
16:23:32  THIS IS GREAT IF YOU'RE -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU
16:23:34  WANT TO, FOR EXAMPLE, RESET YOUR PASSWORD.
16:23:37  YOU'VE SEEN THOSE SIGNED URLS IN THOSE EMAILS
16:23:39  TO RESET YOUR PASSWORD.
16:23:40  THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT THIS IS
16:23:42  TYPICALLY USED FOR.
16:23:45  AND THEN, OF COURSE, MANY OF US WANT TO DO
16:23:47  ALL OF THIS.
16:23:48  OUR APPLICATION USES TWO OF THEM.
16:23:51  WE USE SESSION OFF AND SIGNED OFF.
16:23:53  WE HAVEN'T USED TOKENS, ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT ONE
16:23:56  DAY.
16:23:58  AND SO, OF COURSE, DOING MULTIPLE OF THESE IN
16:24:00  CONCERT ADS EXTRA COMPLICATION AS WELL.
16:24:03  SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH
16:24:06  PERMISSIONS AND GETTING THOSE RIGHT.
16:24:10  THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF
16:24:11  PERMISSIONS THAT I THINK APPLICATION LOGIC
16:24:14  HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT WERE REALLY TRIMMED
16:24:16  DOWN WHEN WE WERE JUST DEALING WITH A
16:24:20  YOUR APPLICATION IS GOING TO HAVE ALL KINDS
16:24:22  OF THINGS.
16:24:18  DEVELOPER API.
16:24:22  IT'S GOING TO HAVE TABLE-LEVEL PERMISSIONS
16:24:25  WHICH IS BASICALLY CAN I GET ALL THE CATS OR
16:24:28  CAN I GET ANY CATS, RIGHT?
16:24:29  CAN I REACH THIS END POINT OR NOT.
16:24:31  DO I HAVE PERMISSION ON THAT.
16:24:33  YOU CAN TALK ABOUT COLUMN-LEVEL PERMISSIONS.
16:24:36  SO DO I GET TO SEE THE PASSWORD FIELD.
16:24:40  DO I GET TO SEE THE PRICE FIELD.
16:24:42  DO I GET TO SEE SOME OF THE OTHER SENSITIVE
16:24:46  DATA.
16:24:46  YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ROW-LEVEL PERMISSIONS.
16:24:48  SO WHICH CATS DO I OWN.
16:24:49  AND THEREFORE, WHICH CATS CAN I LOOK AT,
16:24:53  WHICH CATS CAN I EDIT.
16:24:56  WE CAN TALK ABOUT READ VERSUS WRITE
16:25:01  PERMISSIONS FOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS.
16:25:02  CAN I EDIT THE PRICE OF AN ITEM OR CAN I JUST
16:25:05  READ THE PRICE OF AN ITEM.
16:25:07  AND, OF COURSE, MOST OF US ALREADY KNOW
16:25:10  WRITES ARE MORE COMPLICATED THAN JUST WRITES.
16:25:12  YOU CAN CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE.
16:25:14  THERE ARE LOTS OF COMPLICATED WAYS TO THINK
16:25:17  WE MENTIONED A MINUTE AGO THERE ARE MANY
16:25:20  DIFFERENT WAYS TO AUTHENTICATE A USER AND
16:25:16  ABOUT THAT.
16:25:23  MANY OF US, I THINK, WILL USE AT LEAST TWO.
16:25:26  AND SO SUDDENLY, YOU MIGHT HAVE A USER WHO IS
16:25:29  LOGGED IF BY THEIR SESSION BUT ALSO HAS A
16:25:32  SIGNED URL GRANTING THEM CERTAIN OTHER
16:25:34  PERMISSIONS AND HOW DO THOSE TWO WORK IN
16:25:36  CONCERT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING THE RIGHT
16:25:41  PERMISSIONS SET UP ON THIS THING.
16:25:43  AND OF COURSE, AGAIN, YOU MIGHT WANT ALL OF
16:25:45  THESE THINGS.
16:25:45  AND IN FACT WE REGULARLY DO ALL OF THESE
16:25:47  THINGS AT THE SAME TIME.
16:25:50  AND I THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE JUST HOW
16:25:52  COMPLICATED THAT GETS.
16:25:54  BUT IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE IMAGINING HOW
16:25:57  COMPLICATED THAT GETS, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU.
16:25:59  I WANT TO SHOW YOU A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE.
16:26:01  THIS IS VERY LIGHTLY EDITED FROM OUR CODE
16:26:06  BASE, WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR JUST ONE OF OUR
16:26:08  API END POINTS.
16:26:10  AND I WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH SO YOU GET A
16:26:12  SENSE OF WHAT IT TAKES TO WRITE THE
16:26:14  PERMISSIONS FOR THIS END POINT.
16:26:23  A SPECIAL MIX IN.
16:26:24  WE WROTE THIS THING OURSELVES CALLED A SIGNED
16:26:19  SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT YOU CAN SEE WE'RE USING
16:26:27  VIEW SET MIX IN.
16:26:29  ALLOWS YOU TO DO KIND OF SIGNED URLS.
16:26:32  FROM THERE, WE JUMP DOWN, AND WE SEE
16:26:35  PERMISSION CLASSES.
16:26:36  AND THIS IS WHERE YOU DEFINE WHICH
16:26:38  PERMISSIONS APPLY TO THIS END POINT.
16:26:42  AND THEN YOU SEE IT WEIRD OR THING.
16:26:47  MAYBE A FOURTH PARTY LIBRARY.
16:26:49  OUTSIDE OF DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK CALLED REST
16:26:53  CONDITION, AND IT ALLOWS FOR COMPOSING
16:26:55  VARIOUS PERMISSION CLASSES INTO MORE
16:26:58  COMPLICATED PERMISSION CLASSES.
16:26:59  SO YOU CAN OR, OR AND/OR NOT ANY GIVEN
16:27:04  PERMISSION AND COMBINE THEM ALL TOGETHER INTO
16:27:06  ONE MEGA PERMISSION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WAY
16:27:09  MORE MAINTAINABLE THAN IF YOU HAD TO WRITE
16:27:11  EACH ONE OF THESE OVER AND OVER AND OVER
16:27:12  AGAIN.
16:27:13  SO WE'VE GOT THIS OR, WHICH BASICALLY SAYS IS
16:27:17  ANY OF THE FOLLOWING LINES GIVES THIS PERSON
16:27:21  PERMISSION, THEN THEY'RE GOOD TO GO.
16:27:23  SO THIS IS ALL A LITTLE BIT SPECIFIC TO OUR
16:27:30  OBSCENE AMOUNT OF DEPTH BUT I WANT TO GIVE
16:27:33  YOU AN IDEA HOW COMPLICATED THIS GETS.
16:27:25  APPLICATION SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO AN
16:27:35  THE FIRST ONE IS IF THEY ARE A MEMBER OF THIS
16:27:37  ORGANIZATION AND THE OPERATION IS READ ONLY
16:27:40  OR IF THEY ARE AN ADMIN AT THAT ORGANIZATION,
16:27:43  AND THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO PATCH ANY
16:27:45  PARTICULAR FIELDS THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED
16:27:47  TO PATCH, THIS IS ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAD
16:27:49  TO BUILD CUSTOMS, THIS PATCHABLE FIELDS
16:27:52  FACTORY.
16:27:52  SO FOR EXAMPLE, THEY'RE ABLE TO PATCH, YOU
16:27:56  KNOW, THE GUESS COUNT ON THIS MEAL THAT
16:27:59  THEY'RE GETTING.
16:28:00  WE DO FOOD.
16:28:00  SO ON THIS MEAL THAT THEY'RE GETTING, THEY
16:28:03  CAN PATCH THE GUESS COUNT BUT THEY CAN'T
16:28:05  PATCH THE PRICE ON THEIR OWN.
16:28:06  RIGHT?
16:28:07  THEY CAN'T SET ALL THEIR MEALS TO ZERO
16:28:09  DOLLARS.
16:28:10  THE NEXT THING, IS IT A VENDOR ADMIN.
16:28:14  RIGHT?
16:28:14  WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PARTIES WHO CAN SEE
16:28:16  THIS, OR THE PERSON SELLING IT OR THE PERSON
16:28:19  SO THE VENDER CAN ALSO SEE THIS ORDER.
16:28:22  OR IF YOU ARE BOTH SIGNED PERMISSION AND READ
16:28:18  BUYING IT.
16:28:27  ONLY, SO THIS IS THAT SIGNATURE WE'RE TALKING
16:28:29  ABOUT.
16:28:29  SO YOU CAN ARRIVE HERE WITH A URL WITH A
16:28:31  SIGNED PERMISSION, AND YOU'RE ONLY TAKING A
16:28:33  READ ONLY ACTION, THEN YOU CAN SEE THIS
16:28:36  ORDER, OR IF YOU'RE AN INTERNAL ADMIN USER,
16:28:39  YOU JUST GET PERMISSION.
16:28:41  SO THAT'S ALREADY PRETTY COMPLICATED.
16:28:44  TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO COMPOSE THESE THINGS
16:28:46  TOGETHER.
16:28:48  BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET.
16:28:50  SO THAT WAS JUST FOR OBJECT LEVEL
16:28:53  PERMISSIONS.
16:28:54  WE ALSO NEED TO DO LIST LEVEL PERMISSIONS.
16:28:57  THOSE ARE DONE SEPARATELY IN MOST OF THE
16:28:59  FRAMEWORKS THAT I'VE SEEN.
16:29:00  SO IF YOU WANT TO GET A SINGLE ORDER, THAT'S
16:29:02  WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT BEFORE.
16:29:04  IF YOU WANT TO GET A LIST OF ORDERS, THAT'S
16:29:05  WHAT WE'RE DEFINING HERE NOW.
16:29:07  SO YOU SUBCLASS THIS -- YOU DEFINE A GET
16:29:12  QUERY SET METHOD, AND IF THE USER IS
16:29:20  GET THE -- AND THEY'RE INTERNAL STAFF, THEY
16:29:22  GET THE WHOLE LIST.
16:29:15  AUTHENTICATED AND THEY'RE STAFF, THEN THEY
16:29:23  IF THEY'RE AUTHENTICATED AND THEY'RE NOT
16:29:26  STAFF, THEN YOU DO THIS COMPLICATED QUERY
16:29:28  THAT WE DON'T NEED TO GET INTO THAT HOPEFULLY
16:29:30  DOES ROUGHLY THE SAME THING YOU SAW A MINUTE
16:29:32  A AGO IN THE PERMISSION CLASS LIST.
16:29:34  AND IF THEY'RE NOT AUTHENTICATED, THEY GET
16:29:40  [INAUDIBLE].
16:29:40  OKAY.
16:29:40  SO THAT'S A BASIC EXAMPLE HERE.
16:29:42  I WANT TO TALK REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT KIND OF
16:29:45  WHAT THAT ALL TOOK.
16:29:47  LET'S RECAP WHAT WE JUST SAW AND KIND OF
16:29:50  BREAK IT DOWN.
16:29:51  WE SAW A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIBRARIES BEING
16:29:53  USED.
16:29:54  WE SAW DJANGO REST OF COURSE.
16:29:57  WE SAW REST CONDITION WHICH IS ALSO FORKED
16:29:59  FROM THE ORIGINAL LIBRARY TO FIX A BUG THAT
16:30:03  WE SAW.
16:30:03  SIGNED VIEW SETS WHICH I MENTIONED THAT WE
16:30:05  DO -- WE BUILT IN-HOUSE TO DO SIGNED URLS AND
16:30:11  GET PERMISSIONS THAT WAY, AND THE PATCHABLE
16:30:16  DETERMINES WHICH FIELDS YOU CAN EDIT VERSUS
16:30:18  JUST READ.
16:30:14  FIELDS FACTOR THAT I MENTIONED THAT
16:30:19  SO WE'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF SPECIFIC CODE
16:30:22  THERE.
16:30:23  BUT ACTUALLY, I THINK MORE IMPORTANT IS LET'S
16:30:25  LOOK AT HOW MAY DIFFERENT PLACES IN YOUR CODE
16:30:27  BASE PERMISSIONS EXIST FOR THIS ONE END
16:30:30  POINT.
16:30:34  PERMISSIONS EXIST IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT
16:30:36  LOCATIONS.
16:30:37  YOU SAW THERE WAS A MIX IN THAT WE HAD TO
16:30:39  PROVIDE ON THE VIEW SET CLASS.
16:30:40  THERE WAS A PERMISSION LIST WE WENT ON OVER
16:30:44  ON THE VIEW SET CLASS.
16:30:45  THERE WAS A GET QUERY THAT YOU HAD TO
16:30:48  OVERRIDE.
16:30:49  THERE'S FIELDS YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY ON THE
16:30:51  SERIALIZER CLASS WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN SHOW
16:30:53  YOU.
16:30:53  AND THERE'S PERMISSION CLASSES WHICH YOU SAW
16:30:55  IN USE BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THEIR DEFINITIONS.
16:30:58  THAT'S TOO MANY PLACES.
16:30:59  THAT'S TOO MUCH CODE IN TOO MANY PLACES FOR
16:31:02  YOU TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND BE
16:31:07  I THINK IT IS WAY TOO PRONE TO ERRORS.
16:31:11  I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS WAY TOO
16:31:04  SURE THAT THIS IS WORKING.
16:31:13  COMPLICATED TO REALLY PROPERLY MAINTAIN.
16:31:17  AND I WANT TO MAINTAINABLE SET OF PERMISSIONS
16:31:20  AND AUTHENTICATIONS FOR MY APP.
16:31:22  I THINK THAT THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR
16:31:24  WHERE WE'RE GOING.
16:31:25  SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUTURE
16:31:28  AND WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER HOPEFULLY.
16:31:32  SO THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- SORRY.
16:31:36  I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU UP FRONT.
16:31:38  THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE TALKS THAT
16:31:39  ENDS WITH ME SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD DO
16:31:42  NEXT.
16:31:43  I HAVE SOME IDEAS.
16:31:44  I DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTIONS TODAY FOR YOU.
16:31:45  SO I'M HOPING THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS, AND
16:31:47  YOU GUYS CAN COME UP TO ME AFTERWARDS.
16:31:49  WE CAN TALK AT THE SPRINTS.
16:31:50  I WANT TO MAKE THIS A BETTER WORLD.
16:31:54  I WANT TO MAKE REST SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO
16:31:56  EASILY, AND I WANT OUR TOOLS TO WORK FOR US
16:31:59  INSTEAD OF AGAINST US SO THE PYTHON CAN HAVE
16:32:01  A REALLY STRONG PLACE IN THE WORLD OF WEB
16:32:05  I THINK THIS IS REQUIRED FOR IT.
16:32:06  SO ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
16:32:05  DEVELOPMENT.
16:32:13  [INAUDIBLE] LIBRARIES TO DO THESE THINGS
16:32:15  INSTEAD OF HAVING TO BUILD THIS CUSTOM EVERY
16:32:17  TIME.
16:32:17  WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS.
16:32:19  I WOULD LOVE TO GET IT TO A POINT WHERE IT
16:32:21  CAN BE OPEN SOURCED.
16:32:22  A LOT OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW HOW LONG THAT LAST
16:32:26  MILE IS.
16:32:26  WE'RE INTERESTED IF OPEN SOURCING IT.
16:32:28  SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WORKING ON THIS ON
16:32:31  SOME OF THAT, LET ME KNOW.
16:32:32  I THINK COMBINING OBJECT -- LIST AND OBJECT
16:32:35  PERMISSION S IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT.
16:32:37  ALL THE LIBRARIES THAT I'VE LOOKED AT IF ANY
16:32:39  DEPTH SPLIT THESE UP AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT.
16:32:42  AND I THINK WRITING THE SAME CONCEPT TWO
16:32:45  DIFFERENT TIMES IN TWO DIFFERENT STYLES IN
16:32:48  TWO DIFFERENT PLACES IN YOUR APPLICATION IS
16:32:50  JUST ASKING FOR PROBLEMS.
16:32:52  WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A UNIFIED DESCRIPTION
16:32:55  FOR WHAT THE PERMISSIONS ARE, WHETHER IT'S A
16:32:58  LIST OR A SINGLE OBJECT.
16:33:02  WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
16:33:03  YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE SEPARATE
16:33:00  BECAUSE I THINK 99 PERCENT OF THE TIME THAT'S
16:33:06  SPECIFICATIONS FOR EACH OBJECT.
16:33:09  AND THEN I THINK ORGANIZING PERMISSIONS BY
16:33:13  WHO IS AUTHENTICATED RATHER THAN BY WHAT END
16:33:16  POINT YOU'RE WORKING WITH HAS A LOT OF
16:33:18  PROMISE.
16:33:18  I'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE SPECCING OUT
16:33:20  WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE, AND I'M REALLY
16:33:22  EXCITED ABOUT IT.
16:33:24  LIKE I SAID, I THINK THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH
16:33:26  ALL OF THIS IS THAT THINGS LIVE IN TOO MANY
16:33:28  PLACES AND IT GETS TOO COMPLICATED AND TOO
16:33:30  HARD TO MAINTAIN.
16:33:31  AND IF WE CAN PULL ALL OF THE AUTHENTICATIONS
16:33:34  AND PERMISSIONS INTO ONE CENTRALIZED LOCATION
16:33:37  WHERE YOU DEFINE IT ALL RIGHT THERE, THAT
16:33:38  WILL HELP IMMENSELY.
16:33:40  SO LIKE I SAID, I WANT YOUR HELP.
16:33:45  I THINK THAT THIS WORLD CAN BE SO MUCH BETTER
16:33:47  THAN IT IS.
16:33:50  I WANT US TO MAKE REST BETTER TOGETHER.
16:33:52  YOU GET IT?
16:33:53  YEAH?
16:33:56  KNOW -- LIKE I KEEP HAVING THIS FEELING THAT
16:33:59  WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING FROM SOMEWHERE.
16:33:53  SO IF YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF PRIOR ART, IF YOU
16:34:01  LIKE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.
16:34:04  SOMEONE SOMEWHERE, WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW,
16:34:08  UNIXY THINGS, WHETHER IT'S RUBY OR JAVASCRIPT
16:34:11  EVEN, SOMEONE'S GOT THIS FIGURED OUT REALLY
16:34:13  WELL, I THINK.
16:34:15  AND THEY'RE JUST LAUGHING AT ME RIGHT NOW.
16:34:17  MAYBE YOU ARE, TOO.
16:34:19  AND IF YOU ARE, COME AND TELL ME.
16:34:21  I HAVE TO IMAGINE THERE'S A GOOD SOLUTION TO
16:34:23  THIS SOMEWHERE.
16:34:24  IF YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE ANY GOOD IDEAS ABOUT
16:34:27  THIS, I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THEM.
16:34:28  COME TALK TO ME AFTERWARDS.
16:34:30  I WANT TO MAKE THE WEB BETTER TOGETHER.
16:34:32  I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IN PYTHON.
16:34:34  AND I THINK THAT WE NEED THIS AS A COMMUNITY
16:34:37  IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING THAT.
16:34:39  SO LIKE I SAID, I'M JEFF.
16:34:42  I GOT TO PLUG CHEWSE REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE
16:34:47  THEY PAID ME TO BE HERE.
16:34:50  MY COMPANY CHEWSE IS AWESOME.
16:34:55  THEIR FOOD IS AWESOME.
16:34:58  FIVE MINUTES.
16:35:03  SO YOU GUYS GET TO ASK ME SOME EASY
16:34:56  I'M SORRY, DO WE HAVE A MINUTE AND WE HAVE
16:35:04  QUESTIONS.
16:35:05  [ APPLAUSE ]
16:35:08  >> AUDIENCE:  HEY, JEFF.
16:35:10  >> HI.
16:35:10  >> AUDIENCE:  I'M AN OLD GUY.
16:35:14  AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU MAKE LUNCHES,
16:35:18  AND I LOVE SALT, YOU KNOW, AND SOMETIMES I
16:35:21  LIKE THE SEA SALT, BUT MOST OF THE TIME, YOU
16:35:23  KNOW, THE OPEN WOUND REALLY DEMANDS SOME
16:35:27  KOSHER SALT AND YOU'RE POURING IT IN.
16:35:31  SO I'M GOING TO START BY SAYING WHAT YOU
16:35:32  DON'T WANT TO HEAR.
16:35:33  >>  OKAY.
16:35:34  >> AUDIENCE:  OKAY?
16:35:34  AND WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IS, HI, I'M
16:35:37  FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
16:35:38  I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.
16:35:39  OKAY?
16:35:40  THOSE WORDS ARE DANGEROUS.
16:35:42  BUT IN THIS CASE, WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND THE
16:35:45  SALT AND WHAT MAKES ME HURT SO MUCH AND MAKES
16:35:48  ME SO BITTER IS YOU KEEP USING THE WRONG
16:35:53  OKAY?
16:35:55  THERE'S THIS NICKEL AND DIME ORGANIZATION UP
16:35:52  WORDS.
16:35:59  IN GAITHERSBERG, MARYLAND.
16:36:01  IT'S CALLED THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF
16:36:03  STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY.
16:36:05  OR IF YOU'RE COOL, YOU CAN CALL IT NIST.
16:36:09  OKAY?
16:36:10  AND THEY HAVE SOME PEOPLE THERE WHO DO
16:36:11  NOTHING BUT THINK ABOUT THIS CRAP AND THAT
16:36:14  GET PAID WITH --
16:36:15  >>  I'LL WARN YOU.  I'M NOT COOL AT ALL.
16:36:18  >> AUDIENCE:  HUH?
16:36:19  >>  I'M SORRY.
16:36:19  I WANTED TO WARN YOU I'M NOT COOL AT ALL.
16:36:21  SO.
16:36:21  >>  AUDIENCE:  OKAY.
16:36:22  THAT'S COOL.
16:36:23  BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S
16:36:25  REALLY IMPORTANT TO USE THE RIGHT WORDS.
16:36:27  THE WORDS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND THE TERM
16:36:29  YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS I&A.
16:36:31  OKAY?
16:36:33  IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION.
16:36:35  TWO SEPARATE CONCEPTS.
16:36:41  AND YOU WANT TO USE THOSE WORDS.
16:36:42  OKAY?
16:36:39  AND YOU'RE USING DIFFERENT WORDS.
16:36:43  AND THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT TO
16:36:45  GO TO THE NIST WEBSITE, AND YOU WANT TO SEE
16:36:49  WHAT THE LAST, OH, GOLLY, 40 YEARS OF
16:36:52  INDUSTRIAL AND MILITARY SECURITY HAVE DONE.
16:36:55  OKAY?
16:36:57  THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF OUT THERE.
16:36:59  AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS GERMINATING THE
16:37:02  MOST INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTY FOR SOMEBODY FIVE
16:37:08  YEARS FROM NOW TRYING TO DO SOMETHING WITH,
16:37:11  YOU KNOW, THE PCI STANDARD AND TRYING TO, YOU
16:37:14  KNOW, OH, OKAY, WE WANT TO GET THIS THING SO
16:37:17  WE CAN ACTUALLY RUN CREDIT CARDS THROUGH IT.
16:37:18  YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
16:37:19  >>  CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR, THEN?
16:37:22  >>  AUDIENCE:  AND THE QUESTION IS, DO YOU
16:37:23  THINK YOU CAN MAYBE REWRITE THIS THING TO
16:37:25  HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THE NIST, YOU KNOW,
16:37:31  STANDARD?
16:37:31  IS THAT SOMETHING --
16:37:32  >>  POTENTIALLY, [INAUDIBLE] CAN YOU COME
16:37:36  TALK TO ME?
16:37:37  BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, I WANT TO KNOW THESE
16:37:40  FOR THE RECORD, I DIDN'T WRITE ALMOST ANY OF
16:37:42  THE TOOLS THAT ARE IN USE HERE.
16:37:39  SORT OF THINGS.
16:37:45  BUT YES, I WANT THEM TO BE BETTER, LIKE I
16:37:47  SAID.
16:37:47  SO COME HELP ME AFTERWARDS.
16:37:49  I WOULD LOVE TO TALK.
16:37:49  >>  AUDIENCE:  I'M JUST A OLD GUY.
16:37:53  SO THAT'S COOL.
16:37:56  >>  ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, AND DO WE HAVE TIME
16:37:59  LEFT?
16:38:00  YOU'RE ALL GOOD.
16:38:00  >> I MADE A TIME.
16:38:01  I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.
16:38:02  >> AUDIENCE:  I'M GOING TO PLAY DEVIL'S
16:38:04  ADVOCATE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I TRUST
16:38:06  WHAT I'M SAYING, BUT IF YOU OPENED UP THE
16:38:10  DATABASE DIRECTLY, AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE REST,
16:38:12  THEN HOW MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
16:38:14  CAN BE SUPPORTED?
16:38:15  LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT POSTGRESQL, IT HAS
16:38:19  [INAUDIBLE].
16:38:20  IT HAS LOW LEVEL PERMISSIONS, YOU CAN DO
16:38:23  BUSINESS RULES IN A STORED PROCEDURE.
16:38:25  SO --
16:38:28  KNOW SCHEMA VERSE FROM DEFCON A FEW YEARS
16:38:35  BACK?
16:38:26  >>  I THOUGHT ABOUT BRINGING UP -- DO YOU
16:38:36  >> Audience:  NOT FROM HERE.
16:38:37  >> I'M GOING TO MESS UP SOME PARTS OF IT SO
16:38:40  FORGIVE ME.
16:38:40  THERE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING GAME THAT GOT
16:38:43  CREATED IN POSTGRESQL AT DEFCON THAT SORT OF
16:38:46  TESTED THE LIMITS OF POSTGRESQL'S ABILITY TO
16:38:48  HANDLE THESE SORTS OF PERMISSIONS IN
16:38:51  OBVIOUSLY AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYONE WAS
16:38:53  GOING TO TRY TO MESS WITH IT.
16:38:55  AND THEY BASICALLY MADE A GAME WHERE YOU
16:38:57  WOULD RUN SQUALL COMMANDS AGAINST IT USING
16:39:00  DDSQL COMMANDS AGAINST IT USING
16:39:03  AUTHENTICATION AND -- I'M SORRY.
16:39:05  ALL THE RIGHT TERMS.
16:39:08  AND THAT YOU WON THE GAME BY EITHER CHEATING
16:39:10  IF YOU COULD PROVE THAT YOU COULD BREAK IT OR
16:39:12  ACTUALLY WORKING WITH IT.
16:39:14  BUT YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOU.
16:39:15  I THINK THERE ARE SOME REALLY INTERESTING
16:39:17  THINGS WE COULD EXPLORE IN TERMS OF EXISTING
16:39:21  SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY WORK WITH THIS STUFF.
16:39:25  AND I THINK POSTGRESQL, YOU'RE RIGHT,
16:39:28  TRIED TO STRESS TEST IT THAT WAY BUT
16:39:30  EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD IT'S BETTER THAN YOU
16:39:26  EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT, I HAVEN'T
16:39:33  MIGHT THINK OF THIS STUFF.
16:39:35  >>  YEAH, BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE YOUR COMMENT
16:39:36  THAT HAVING ONE THING IN TWO OR THREE OR FOUR
16:39:39  DIFFERENT PLACES IS BAD.
16:39:42  AND THESE REST APPLICATIONS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS
16:39:44  DATABASE BACKED.
16:39:45  SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE DATABASE.
16:39:46  IT HAS TO HAVE ITS OWN PERMISSIONS.
16:39:49  SO TO WHAT EXTENT CAN WE JUST HAVE IT THERE
16:39:52  AND NO WHERE ELSE?
16:39:53  >>  SURE.
16:39:57  >> Audience:  THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT THANK YOU.
16:40:00  >> WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE.
16:40:01  >> OKAY.
16:40:02  >> Audience:  SO I'VE DONE A SIMILAR KIND OF
16:40:04  COMPOSED PERMISSION SYSTEM, AND WE HAVE
16:40:07  PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS AS A RESULT.
16:40:08  WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS DONE LIKE, YOU KNOW, IN
16:40:12  QUERIES TYPE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DOING
16:40:16  [INAUDIBLE] AND PAGINATION AND ALL THAT.
16:40:17  >> WE ARE LUCKY TO BE A RELATIVELY SMALL
16:40:20  START-UP AND DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT
16:40:25  BUT I LIKE -- SO I DON'T DIRECTLY HAVE THE
16:40:31  ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.
16:40:23  OF SCALE ISSUES YET.
16:40:32  I THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN WORK
16:40:35  WITH CACHING.
16:40:36  I THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN WORK
16:40:37  WITH STREAMLINING THESE PERMISSIONS.
16:40:40  I WOULD LIKE TO FIND A WAY ALSO -- BECAUSE I
16:40:42  THINK, YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOK AT THOSE SORTS
16:40:44  OF THINGS, I FALL INTO THE SAME THINKING THAT
16:40:46  YOU SEEM TO HAVE RUN INTO AS AN ACTUAL ISSUE,
16:40:49  WHICH IS ARE WE REALLY GOING TO EXECUTE A
16:40:51  DATABASE QUERY FOR EACH OF THESE THINGS IN
16:40:53  THIS OR AND ISN'T THAT PRETTY AWFUL.
16:40:56  AND I THINK IT IS.
16:40:57  AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A WAY TO BOTH
16:40:59  COMBINE ALL OF YOUR PERMISSIONS INTO ONE
16:41:02  LOCATION AS WELL AS COMBINE THE QUERIES,
16:41:06  COMBINE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING.
16:41:08  SO DEPENDING ON THE SCALE OF YOUR
16:41:10  APPLICATION, THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS YOU
16:41:11  HAVE TO DO WITH CACHING AND WHATEVER ELSE.
16:41:13  BUT I THINK THAT COMBINING PERMISSIONS CAN
16:41:16  ALSO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THAT, IF THAT
16:41:20  MAKES SENSE.
16:41:23  >>  THANKS, EVERYBODY, FOR COMING OUT.
16:41:26  TALKS ARE HAPPENING NEXT DOOR.
16:41:22  >> Audience:  COOL.
16:41:28  ENJOY YOUR PYTHON.
