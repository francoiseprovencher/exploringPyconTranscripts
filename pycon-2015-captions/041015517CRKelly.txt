           APRIL 10, 2015 PYCON, 517C, 11:30 - 12:10
           [ MUSIC ]
00:39:43   >> HEY, FOLKS.
00:40:08   WELCOME TO THE SESSION, SECOND SESSION OF YOUR
00:40:15   PYCON 2015.
00:40:17   WE'RE HERE TODAY WITH RYAN KELLY, A DEVELOPER ON
00:40:19   THE MOZILLA ACCOUNT TEAM, AND HE'S GOING TO BE
00:40:23   TALKING TO US ABOUT PYPY.JS.
00:40:38   >> IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT ME.
00:40:40   THERE WE GO.
00:40:40   AS YOU JUST HEARD, I WORK FOR MOZILLA, AND IF
00:40:43   YOU'VE HEARD OF MOZILLA, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE WE
00:40:46   MAKE A PRETTY AWESOME WEB BROWSER, CALLED
00:40:48   FIREFOX, WHICH BY THE WAY I'M USING FOR MY SLIDES
00:40:52   HERE TODAY.
00:40:52   BUT MOZILLA AS A COMPANY AND AS A WORLDWIDE
00:40:57   COMMUNITY OF VOLUNTEERS, WE'RE ABOUT A LOT MORE
00:40:59   THAN JUST, HEY, LET'S MAKE FIREFOX A REALLY
00:41:02   AWESOME WEB BROWSER.
00:41:04   AT ITS CORE, THE THING THAT DRIVES MOZILLA AND
00:41:08   FUNNILY ENOUGH, THE THING THAT DRIVES ALL THE
00:41:10   MATERIAL IN THIS TALK, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS OUR
00:41:12   MISSION TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE WEB.
00:41:15   ALL RIGHT, THE WEB AS A SHARED GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY
00:41:17   BLATT FORM AND AS A RESOURCE FOR EMPOWERMENT AND
00:41:21   INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY.
00:41:25   BUT WHEN I SAY "THE WEB," I'M REALLY KIND OF
00:41:28   TALKING ABOUT TWO BUT DIFFERENT INTERRELATED
00:41:30   THINGS.
00:41:30   AS ENGINEERS, WE TALK ABOUT THE WEB, WE TEND TO
00:41:32   THINK OF THE TECHNOLOGY STACK OF THE WEB, RIGHT?
00:41:35   THINGS LIKE HIGHWAYS HSMP, JAVASCRIPT, BUT FROM A
00:41:41   PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE OR PERHAPS FROM A CULTURAL
00:41:43   PERSPECTIVE, THE WEB ALSO HAS A LOT OF RATHER YOU
00:41:47   NUKE PROPERTIES.
00:41:48   SO ONE OF THE THING PEOPLE TENDS TO LOVE ABOUT
00:41:50   THE WEB, IT'S A REALLY OPEN SYSTEM.
00:41:52   IF YOU WANT TO PUBLISH SOMETHING ON THE WEB, YOU
00:41:54   DON'T SUBMIT IT TO THE WEB STORE AND THEN TWIDDLE
00:41:56   YOUR THUMBS FOR SIX MONTHS WHILE SOMEONE ON THE
00:41:59   OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD REVIEWS YOUR
00:42:01   COMPATIBILITIES WITH THE WEB STEMS OF SERVICE AND
00:42:03   REJECT YOU ON A TECHNICALITY.
00:42:05   YOU GET A DOMAIN NAME, PUT IT ON THE WEB AND TELL
00:42:08   PEOPLE TO GET IT.
00:42:09   LIKEWISE, IF PEOPLE WANT TO CONSUME YOUR STUFF ON
00:42:11   THE WEB, THEY DON'T NEED A PARTICULAR DEVICE OR
00:42:13   VENDOR OR SOFTWARE, YOU KNOW, IT'S OPEN FOR BOTH
00:42:17   PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS.
00:42:19   THE WEB ALSO HAS A PRETTY INTERESTING KIND OF
00:42:22   SECURITY STORY.
00:42:23   ALL ABOUT RUNNING UNTRUSTED CODE YOU'VE NEVER
00:42:25   SEEN BEFORE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T LET PEOPLE HACK
00:42:28   YOU, DOESN'T LET PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT YOUR
00:42:30   INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER SITES AND SO FORTH SO THE
00:42:32   WEB IS PRETTY UNIQUE.
00:42:34   THE PROBLEM IS, I COULD VERY EASILY HAVE LABELED
00:42:37   THESE COLUMNS THUSLY.
00:42:39   ALL RIGHT?
00:42:40   THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE, NOT
00:42:43   TERRIBLY FOND OF THE TECHNOLOGY STACK OF THE WEB.
00:42:46   A LOT OF PEOPLE GO SO FAR AS SO WISH THAT THE WEB
00:42:48   WOULD JUST HURRY UP AND DIE SO WE CAN REPLACE
00:42:51   WITNESS SOMETHING BETTER, ALL RIGHT?
00:42:53   BUT THE PROBLEM S YOU CAN'T JUST THROW AWAY THE
00:42:56   TECH STACK OF THE WEB AND KEEP ALL THE GOOD
00:42:58   CULTURAL PROPERTIES OF THE WEB, THE TWO ARE FOR
00:43:00   BETTER OR WORSE INTERTWINED.
00:43:01   SO FOR ALL ITS FLAWS, I FEEL LIKE THE WEB REALLY
00:43:06   IS WORTH KEEPING, AND IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT,
00:43:08   THEN WE SHOULD BE WORKING TO TRY TO MAKE IT
00:43:10   BETTER.
00:43:11   AND OUR CTO, ANDREAS, PUT THIS IN AN INTERESTING
00:43:15   WAY, FOR MOW STILL LARKS ANYTHING THAT THE WEB
00:43:17   CAN'T DO, ANY TIME THE WEB ISN'T FASTER OR BETTER
00:43:22   THAN NATIVE TECHNOLOGY, ANY TIME SOMEONE REACHES
00:43:25   FOR A NATIVE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE THEY THINK THE
00:43:27   WEB ISN'T UP TO THE CHALLENGE, WE SHOULD THINK OF
00:43:29   THAT AS A BUG.
00:43:30   WE SHOULD FILE IT AND WORK TOWARDS GETTING IT
00:43:33   FIST.
00:43:33   AS A PYTHONNISTA, I HAVE NOTICED ONE OF THESE
00:43:37   BUGS IN THE WEB AND MAYBE YOU'VE NOTICED IT, TOO,
00:43:40   RIGHT?
00:43:40   I WANT TO CODE IN PYTHON AND THAT'S KIND OF HARD
00:43:43   TO DO ON THE WEB RIGHT NOW, WHICH BRINGS ME TO
00:43:45   THE TOPIC OF THIS TALK.
00:43:46   THIS IS MY KIND OF EXPERIMENT IN WHAT'S POSSIBLE
00:43:50   IN BRINGING PYTHON TO THE WEB, A PROJECT CALLED
00:43:53   PYPY.JS.
00:43:54   I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IT IS,
00:43:56   HOW IT CAME TOGETHER AND WHY ON EARTH I'M WORKING
00:43:58   ON THIS THING.
00:43:59   SO THE WHAT IN A SENSE IS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD,
00:44:03   THE PYPY, PYTHON INTERPRETER, IMPORTED TO THE
00:44:06   WEB.
00:44:07   AND IN MY HEAD, IN TALK, THIS IS LIKE A TA-DA
00:44:11   SLIDE, LIKE TADA!!
00:44:13   IF I COULD TYPE WITH MY HANDS WEREN'T SHAKING,
00:44:17   PYTHON ON THE WEB, ALL RIGHT?
00:44:18   [ Applause ]
00:44:18
00:44:19   >> THANK YOU.
00:44:19   THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.
00:44:21   I FEEL LIKE IN THIS DAY AND AGE, A LOT OF PEOPLE
00:44:24   HAVE SEEN THIS SORT OF THING BEFORE, RIGHT?
00:44:25   THIS IS NOT THE FIRST PROJECT TRYING TO PUT
00:44:27   PYTHON ON THE WEB BY ANY STRETCH OF THE
00:44:29   IMAGINATION.
00:44:29   IT ALMOST CERTAINLY WON'T BE THE LAST.
00:44:31   SO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY
00:44:34   I'M DOING SOMETHING NEW.
00:44:35   AND FOR ME, TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THE WEB
00:44:38   SUPPORTS PYTHON IN A MEANINGFUL SENSE, YOU HAVE
00:44:40   TO TICK THREE BOXES WHICH I WANT TO EXPLAIN BY
00:44:42   WAY OF DEMONSTRATION.
00:44:44   AND THE FIRST POINT IS THAT I -- WHEN I SAY I
00:44:47   WANT TO CODE IN PYTHON, I ACTUALLY WANT PYTHON,
00:44:49   RIGHT?
00:44:50   SO IF I HAVE A NUMBER AND I PUT IT TO THE POWER
00:44:53   OF ANOTHER NUMBER, RIGHT, I SHOULD GET A BIG
00:44:55   NUMBER BACK IN RESPONSE.
00:44:58   IF I WERE TO ASK JAVASCRIPT AND ITS NUMBER MODEL
00:45:00   THAT SAME QUESTION, IT WOULD TELL ME THE ANSWER
00:45:02   IS INFINITY.
00:45:03   WHICH IS OFF BY A LITTLE BIT.
00:45:06   IN I WERE IN JAVASCRIPT AND I DID THIS, RIGHT, IT
00:45:10   WOULDN'T GIVE ME AN EXCEPTION DESPITE THE FACT
00:45:12   THAT I ALMOST CERTAINLY DIDN'T WANT THAT, IT
00:45:14   WOULD TELL ME INFINITY, WHICH I ALSO ALMOST
00:45:17   CERTAINLY DON'T WANT BUT WILL PROBABLY GO AHEAD
00:45:19   AND USE.
00:45:20   SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN IS
00:45:22   GETTING A FULLY COMPATIBLE PYTHON ENVIRONMENT.
00:45:25   AND IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBERS, RIGHT?
00:45:26   IN PYTHON, WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE THIS.
00:45:29   EQUALS SOME NUMBER, RIGHT, AND WE GET IT IN THE
00:45:34   GLOBAL SCOPE.
00:45:35   WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE GET FRAME AND MUTATE THE
00:45:41   VARIABLES THROUGH THAT.
00:45:43   ALL OF THESE FUN STUFF THAT WE'VE COME TO EXPECT
00:45:45   FROM PYTHON WE SHOULD ALSO EXPECT FROM THE WEB.
00:45:47   THE SECOND POINT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN
00:45:49   PERFORMANCE, AND THIS ISN'T TO SAY LIKE I WANT TO
00:45:52   DO SUPER FOUR TREND NUMBER CRUNCHING OR ANYTHING
00:45:55   LIKE THAT BUT IF I GO OVER HERE TO MY SYSTEM
00:45:58   PYTHON, RIGHT, AND I HAVE SOME CODE, FOR EXAMPLE,
00:46:01   THIS IS A BENCHMARK THAT'S JUST BY DEFAULT WITH
00:46:04   PYTHON WHICH IS REALLY GOOD FOR DEMONSTRATIONS,
00:46:07   IF I HAVE SOME CODE THAT I CAN RUN IN MY NATIVE
00:46:10   PYTHON ENVIRONMENT, RUNS AT ABOUT 140 PY STONES
00:46:14   PER SECOND, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO THE WEB, I
00:46:16   SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING AND I SHOULD
00:46:18   BE ABLE TO RUN WITH COMPARABLE SPEED, RIGHT?
00:46:21   AS IT HAPPENS IN THIS CASE, IT RUNS IT
00:46:24   SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN THE SYSTEM PYTHON.
00:46:27   THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS PYPY AND PYPY IS AWESOME,
00:46:30   AND IF I DO IT AGAIN, IT WILL GO FASTER.
00:46:33   BUT I WOULD SETTLE FOR COMPARABLE, RIGHT?
00:46:35   THE WEB SHOULDN'T BE BLOCKING ME FROM DOING
00:46:37   THINGS FAST IN PYTHON.
00:46:38   THE THIRD THING I REALLY CARE ABOUT, FOR WANT OF
00:46:41   A BETTER WORD, I'M CALLING WEBBISHNESS.
00:46:43   BUT JUST TO SAY, HAVING A PYTHON CONSULT ON
00:46:47   THE -- CONSOLE ON THE WEB IS FUN BUT I WANT
00:46:51   SOMETHING OFF THE WEB, I DON'T WANT TO TYPE INTO
00:46:53   A PYTHON SAND BOX, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO INTERACT
00:46:55   WITH THE HOST JAVA SCRIPT ENVIRONMENT AND DO
00:46:58   THINGS LIKE EVALUATE JAVASCRIPT AND GET ANSWERS
00:47:01   BACK WHICH ARE NOT PYTHON NUMBERS, THEY'RE WEIRD
00:47:04   DOUBLES.
00:47:04   I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE ALL OF THE KIND OF
00:47:08   BROWSER AND DOM INTERACTION STUFF.
00:47:13   TA-DA.
00:47:14   AS YOU CAN TELL, I'M VERY SKILLED AT FRONT-END
00:47:17   DEVELOPMENT, I KNOW ALL ABOUT ALERTING, HELLO,
00:47:19   WORLD.
00:47:20   I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE, FOR EXAMPLE, LINE
00:47:25   PRAYERS THAT ARE WRITTEN IN JAVASCRIPT AND HAVE
00:47:28   THEM OPERATE IN A SENSIBLE WAY.
00:47:29   FOR EXAMPLE, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO JUST J QUERY TO
00:47:33   FIND THIS CONSOLE WINDOW AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO
00:47:35   SET ITS BACKGROUND COLOR, AGAIN, IF I COULD
00:47:39   TYPE...
00:47:39   TO SOMETHING FUN LIKE CHARTRUESE.
00:47:44   [ Applause ]
00:47:47   IF I WANT TO GET REALLY FANCY, I WANT TO BE ABLE
00:47:49   TO DEFINE LIKE A CALL-BACK FUNCTION, IN PYTHON,
00:47:54   ALL RIGHT?
00:47:55   AND RETURN, SAY, A CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURELY
00:48:01   GENERATED RANDOM NUMBER -- I HOPE THIS IS GOING
00:48:06   TO WORK.
00:48:07   AND PASS THAT INTO JAVASCRIPT.
00:48:13   NOW CAN ANYONE SPOT MY BUG?
00:48:18   OH, URANDOM.
00:48:20   I USUALLY MAKE A HABIT OF PRE-RECORDING THESE
00:48:27   THINGS BUT IT WOULD LOSE SOME OF THE APPEAL.
00:48:31   NO!!
00:48:32   SORRY?
00:48:35   I'M GOING TO USE UP ALL OF MY TIME, BUT A FUN
00:48:38   DEMO SO I'M GOING TO PERSIST.
00:48:40   THERE WE GO.
00:48:41   SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY OF THE WEB IN A
00:48:46   MEANINGFUL SENSE.
00:48:47   NOW, AS A GENERAL RULE, ALL RIGHT, IF AN ENGINEER
00:48:50   IDENTIFIES THREE DESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF A
00:48:53   SYSTEM, THEY ARE ABOUT TO ASK YOU TO PICK TWO OF
00:48:56   THEM.
00:48:57   AND PYTHON ON THE WEB SUFFERS FROM THIS IN A VERY
00:49:00   SERIOUS WAY, RIGHTS?
00:49:01   THERE ARE PROJECTS LIKE SOME OF THESE THAT I'VE
00:49:04   IDENTIFIED HERE THAT WILL GIVE YOU A PYTHON
00:49:07   SYNTAX THAT WILL TRANSLATE IT MORE OR LESS
00:49:10   DIRECTLY INTO JAVASCRIPT, SO YOU GET THINGS LIKE
00:49:13   JAVASCRIPT'S MODEL NUMBER, THEIR OBJECT BEHAVIOR
00:49:16   WHICH RUNS REALLY FAST IN THE BROWSER BUT, YOU
00:49:18   KNOW, ISN'T PYTHON IN A VERY REAL SENSE.
00:49:21   THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT PUT A LOT MORE EFFORT
00:49:23   INTO BEING COMPATIBLE WITH PYTHON BUT THEY PAY
00:49:25   FOR IT BECAUSE THIS STUFF LIKE GENERATORS AND MED
00:49:29   CLASSES AND FRAMES ARE REALLY HARD SO THEY DON'T
00:49:31   RUN AS FAST AS THEY COULD.
00:49:34   AND IF YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT BEING ON THE
00:49:35   WEB, WELL, YOU CAN JUST RUN C PYTHON OR PYPY, AND
00:49:39   PUT A LITTLE SHELL WINDOW AND SHELL OUT TO IT
00:49:41   FROM YOUR BROWSER.
00:49:42   MY QUESTION IS, CAN WE HIT ALL THREE OF THESE?
00:49:47   AND PYPY.JS IS KIND OF MY EXPERIMENT IN TRYING TO
00:49:49   DO THAT.
00:49:50   PROMISING LITTLE DEMOS ASIDE, I'M GOING TO LEAVE
00:49:52   THAT AS AN OPEN QUESTION FOR NOW AND COME BACK TO
00:49:54   IT BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO DIVE INTO THE HOW
00:49:57   BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING.
00:49:59   THIS PROJECT IS ESSENTIALLY A COMING TOGETHER OF
00:50:03   TWO EXCITING RELATIVELY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, ONE IN
00:50:05   THE PYTHON WORLD AND ONE IN THE JAVASCRIPT WORLD.
00:50:07   THE FIRST OF THEM IS PYPY.
00:50:09   SO WHO KNOWS ABOUT PYPY?
00:50:10   ALMOST EVERYONE, AWESOME.
00:50:12   PYPY IS FANTASTIC.
00:50:13   IT'S A PYTHON INTERPRETER WRITTEN IN PYTHON.
00:50:16   WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE IDEA, ACTUALLY TURNS
00:50:18   OUTS TO BE A GREAT IDEA.
00:50:20   BECAUSE THEY HAVE TWO TRICKS FOR MAKING IT RUN
00:50:22   REALLY FAST, RIGHT?
00:50:23   THE FIRST IS THEY RIGHT IT IN A RESTRICTED SUBSET
00:50:29   OF PYTHON, WHICH IF YOU'RE A COMPILER GENIUS OR
00:50:32   TWO AND YOU EXERT A TREMENDOUS FORCE OF WILL IN
00:50:35   YOUR COMPILATION TOOL CHAIN, YOU CAN TRANSLATE
00:50:38   OUR PYTHON INTO C WHICH MEANS YOU CAN COMPILE IT
00:50:41   INTO A NATIVE EXECUTABLE.
00:50:42   THE OTHER FUN THING THEY HAVE IS ADJUSTING TIME
00:50:46   COMPILER, NOT ADJUSTING, ADJUSTING TIME COMPILER
00:50:51   GENERATOR.
00:50:52   THAT MEANS DURING THIS PROCESS FROM PYTHON
00:50:55   INTERPRETER TO PYTHON INTERPRETER FOR C, YOU CAN
00:50:56   KINDS OF TRANSPARENTLY PUTS ADJUSTING TIME
00:50:59   COMPILER IN THERE, SO AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH LEVEL,
00:51:02   ELIMINATING A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS, THE
00:51:05   PYPY KIND OF TOOL CHAIN LOOKS LIKE THIS.
00:51:07   YOU START WITH A PYTHON INTERPRETER WRITTEN IN
00:51:09   PYTHON YOU RUN ITS THROUGH THIS R-PYTHON
00:51:13   COMPILATION TOOL CHAIN TO GET THE C FILES.
00:51:14   YOU COMPILE THE C FILES WITH A NORMAL COMPILER TO
00:51:17   GET A NATIVE PYTHON INTERPRETER.
00:51:18   YOU FEED YOUR PYTHON CODE INTO IT, AND THIS GOES
00:51:22   THROUGH THE JUST IN TIME COMPILER, TRACES WHAT
00:51:24   THE HOT PADS ARE AND EMITS KINDS OF THIS NATIVE
00:51:28   APPROXIMATION OF THE IMPORTANT BITS OF YOUR CODE,
00:51:30   SO YOU WIND UP RUNNING KINDS OF NATIVELY, WHICH
00:51:33   IS WHY PYPY HAS THIS DESERVED REPUTATION FOR
00:51:37   BEING A VERY FAST PYTHON INTERPRETER.
00:51:38   FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT
00:51:41   PYPY IS THAT IT'S TARGETED AS A PLATFORM FOR
00:51:45   EXPERIMENTATION, BECAUSE IT'S WRITTEN IN PYTHON,
00:51:46   YOU KNOW, IT'S RELATIVELY APPROACHABLE, I WON'T
00:51:49   SAY EASY BUT AN APPROACHABLE PROBLEM TO KIND OF
00:51:52   GO AND BUT A DIFFERENT GARBAGE COLLECTOR IN THERE
00:51:54   OR BUT A DIFFERENT JIT BACK IN THERE, THINGS LIKE
00:51:59   THAT.
00:51:59   THE SECOND PROJECT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IS
00:52:01   ENSCRIPTIN.
00:52:02   WHO'S HEARD OF THAT?
00:52:04   ALMOST EVERYONE,.
00:52:06   THAT'S A BACK ENDS ARE FOR THE LLVM COMPILER TOOL
00:52:10   CHAIN BUT INSTEAD OF GENERATING LIKE X86 OR
00:52:13   NATIVE CODE, IT GENERATES JAVASCRIPT WHICH AGAIN
00:52:15   SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE IDEA.
00:52:17   BUT ACTUALLY WORKS OUT REALLY WELL IN PRACTICE.
00:52:19   IN ADDITION TO THIS, IT'S ALSO BASICALLY A LITTLE
00:52:22   SIMULATED SAND BOX ENVIRONMENT FOR THE WEB SO HAS
00:52:26   SIS.H, STUBBED OUT DEVICES AND GET TIME OF DAY
00:52:31   AND ALL THIS STUFF IN A LITTLE SAND BOX ON THE
00:52:33   WEB, AND THE GUY THAT STARTED THIS, A GUY NAMED
00:52:37   ALONZO KAYE, WHEN I MET HIM AND HAD THE
00:52:42   OPPORTUNITY TO ASK HIM ABOUT THE INSPIRATION FOR
00:52:43   IT, HIS EXPLANATION FOR THIS WHOLE ELABORATE
00:52:45   PROJECT WAS BASICALLY, LOOK, I WAS WORKING ON
00:52:48   THIS GAME AND IT WAS IN C PLUS PLUS, AND I WANT
00:52:52   TO RUN IT ON THE WEB.
00:52:55   AND I SAID, OKAY.
00:52:57   I SALUTE YOU IN YOUR CRAZY COMPILER GENIUS WAYS.
00:53:01   IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO PUT THIS THING ON THE
00:53:03   WEB, CPLUSPLUS, HE DISCOVERED THAT INSIDE OF I
00:53:07   CAN'T HAVE ASCRIPT, THERE IS A WEIRD MIX OF
00:53:09   HIGH-LEVEL AND LOW-LEVEL FEATURES LIKE CLOSURES
00:53:12   THAT HAVE REALLY GOOD KIND OF NAME REFERENCE
00:53:14   PROTECTION, AND 32-BIT BITWISE OPERATESSORS, BITS
00:53:18   AND PIECES LIKE THIS.
00:53:19   IT TURNS OUT IF YOU KIND OF CARVE OUT A STRANGE
00:53:21   LITTLE BOUNDARY AROUND A LOT OF THE PARTS OF
00:53:23   JAVASCRIPT AND JUST USE THIS ONE LITTLE SUBSET,
00:53:27   WHAT YOU HAVE IS A 32 BIT ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE IN
00:53:29   DISGUISE.
00:53:32   AND SO THE INSCRIPTIN PROJECT BASICALLY TARGETS
00:53:37   THIS SUBSET.
00:53:38   THE WAY IT WORKS IS AS FOLLOWS.
00:53:39   YOU START WITH SOME CODE RIN IN C OR WHATEVER
00:53:42   LANGUAGE YOU CAN TARGET LLVM IN.
00:53:46   IT LOOKS -- A WRAP-AROUND LLVM TOOL CHAIN AND
00:53:50   SPITS OUT JAVA SCRIPTS.
00:53:52   YOU PUTS THAT IN YOUR BROWSER AND BROWSERS HAVE,
00:53:54   YOU KNOW, REALLY POWERFUL JIT COMPILERS IN
00:53:57   THEMSELVES SO THE BROWSER WILL TAKE THAT CODES
00:53:59   AND TURN IT INTO A NATIVE APPROXIMATION OF THE
00:54:02   IMPORTANT PARTS OF THAT CODE.
00:54:03   SO YOU WIND UP IN THE SAME PLACE YOU WOULD HAVE
00:54:06   IF YOU WERE YOURSING SOMETHING LIKE GCC, BUT YOU
00:54:09   KIND OF INDIRECTING THROUGH JAVASCRIPT IN THE
00:54:11   BROWSER.
00:54:12   NOW, THERE'S ONE OBVIOUS THING TO DO FROM THIS
00:54:16   POINT, RIGHT?
00:54:17   AND THAT'S TO TAKE THESE TWO PROJECT AND SMOOSH
00:54:20   THEM TOGETHER.
00:54:20   WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
00:54:22   SO IT LOOKS LIKE THIS, RIGHT?
00:54:24   YOU HAVE THIS PYTHON INTERPRETER THAT'S WRITTEN
00:54:26   IN PYTHON, YOU RUN IT THROUGH THE R-PYTHON TOOL
00:54:29   CHAIN TO GET A BUNCH OF C FILINGS, YOU YOU KNOW
00:54:32   THROUGH THOSE INSCRIPT TIN, YOU GIVE IT TO YOUR
00:54:35   BROWSER.
00:54:35   I CAN FEED PYTHON INTO THAT CODES AND BECAUSE I
00:54:38   STARTED WITH AN INTERPRETER WRITTEN IN PYTHON,
00:54:40   NOT THAT BIG A DEAL TO CHANGE ITS JIT TO EMIT
00:54:43   JAVASCRIPT AT RUN TIME FOR THE POSITIVE CODE,
00:54:46   WHICH THE BROWSER WILL JIT BACK INTO NATIVE CODE.
00:54:50   SO YOU GET TO WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE BUT GOING
00:54:52   THROUGH THE BROWSER, WHICH IS LOVELY.
00:54:53   NOW, YOU STARTED TO CLAP THEN BUT COME ON, BE
00:54:55   HONEST, WHO'S FIRST THOUGHT UPON SEEING THIS
00:54:58   DIAGRAM WAS APPROXIMATELY THAT IS AWFUL?
00:55:01   [ Laughter ]
00:55:02   THAT'S FINE, THAT'S FINE.
00:55:04   I THINK THAT'S FAIR BUT I DO WANTS YOU TO
00:55:05   CONSIDER THIS, RIGHT?
00:55:07   I'VE BEEN CALLING THIS FINAL THING NATIVE CODE.
00:55:09   BUT IT REALLY AIN'T THESE DAYS.
00:55:12   RIGHT?
00:55:12   WHEN THAT CODE HITS THE CPU, THE CPU IS GOING TO
00:55:15   TRANSLATE THAT INTO ITS OWN INTERNAL
00:55:17   REPRESENTATION OF LIKE MARKER OPERATIONS AND DO
00:55:21   LIKE VIRTUAL REGISTER ALLOCATION AND TRY TO
00:55:23   PREDICTS WHICH BRANCHES YOUR CODES IS GOING TO
00:55:25   TAKE AND SPECK LaACTIVELY EXECUTE THEM AND
00:55:27   STITCH THEM BACK TOGETHER IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT
00:55:28   PROPERLY, RIGHT?
00:55:30   YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT JUST, WELL, HERE'S NATIVE
00:55:32   CODE AND IT RUNS IN THE SILICON.
00:55:35   SO, YES, THIS IS KIND OF AN AWFUL COLLECTION OF
00:55:38   WEIRD BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY HACKS AND LAYERING
00:55:40   VIOLATIONS, BUT THE LAST 30 YEARS OF MODERN
00:55:45   COMPUTING ARE BUILT ON EXACTLY THIS KIND OF WEIRD
00:55:47   BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY...
00:55:50   [ Applause ]
00:55:53   >> IT'S AWFUL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON.
00:55:55   SO THE QUESTION IS NOT LIKE IS THIS A NICE
00:55:58   ANYONE?
00:55:59   OF COURSE IT'S NOT THE SYSTEM WE WOULD BUILD IF
00:56:01   WE WERE DESIGNING AN ELEGANT CATHEDRAL FROM
00:56:03   SCRATCH.
00:56:03   THE QUESTION IS, IS IT WORTH IT?
00:56:05   NOW, AS MOZILLANS, WE HAVE SOMETHING OF A HABIT
00:56:09   OF PUBLICLY TRACKING OUR PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS,
00:56:13   SO WHEN THE JAVASCRIPT PERFORMANCE WORDS WARS
00:56:16   WERE HEATING UP, LIKE THE TEAM THAT MOZILLA
00:56:19   CYCLED, FASTNETS.COM WHERE YOU COULD TRACK
00:56:21   PERFORMANCE METRICS.
00:56:23   WAY BACK WHEN FIREFOX WAS A LITTLE BITS OF A
00:56:25   MEMORY HOG, LET'S BE HONEST, THE TEAM WORKING ON
00:56:28   THAT MADE THE CYCLE, ARE WE SLIM YET.COM WHERE
00:56:30   YOU COULD TRACK THE PERFORMANCE?
00:56:32   SO I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CYCLE, ARE WE PYTHON
00:56:36   YET.COM, WHICH DOESN'T FIT ON MY SLIDES, WHERE
00:56:39   YOU CAN GO AND CHECK OUT OUR KIND OF PERFORMANCE
00:56:43   BENCHMARKS.
00:56:44   ZOOM OUT OF THAT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
00:56:47   SO WE HAVE SOME PERFORMANCE TRACKING BENCHMARKS,
00:56:49   SOME START-UP OVERHEAD BENCHMARKS.
00:56:51   LETS ME GIVE YOU THE KINDS OF HIGHLIGHTS.
00:56:54   FIRST THE GOOD BITS.
00:56:55   THIS IS OUR PERFORMANCE TRACKING.
00:56:57   THIS IS PERFORMANCE OF PYPY IN THE BROWSER,
00:56:59   NORMALIZED TO A NATIVE C-PYTHON INTERPRETER.
00:57:02   ACROSS BOTH FIREFOX AND CHROME AND YOU CAN SEE
00:57:06   DOWN AT THE BOTTOM HERE, THIS IS ABOUT 1.4 TIMES
00:57:08   SLOWER THAN NATIVE, WHICH IS NOT TOO BAD.
00:57:10   IF I TAKE CHROME OUT OF THE MIX, HAPPY TO REPORT
00:57:13   THAT IT AVERAGES OUT AT 1.2 TIMES FASTER THAN THE
00:57:16   NATIVE PYTHON ON MY MACHINE.
00:57:18   ACROSS THESE EIGHT BENCHMARKS, WHICH IS PRETTY
00:57:23   COOL.
00:57:23   OF COURSE, IF I COMPARE IT TO A NATIVE PYPY
00:57:26   INTERPRETER LIKE THE NATIVE PYPY IS GOING ON TO
00:57:28   BE FASTER THAN THE WEB, THIS ONE OUTLIER, WE'RE
00:57:32   OPERATING AT BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN TIMES SLOWER
00:57:35   THAN A NATIVE PYPY, WITH ALL OF ITS AMAZING KIND
00:57:38   OF YEARS OF WORK PUT INTO JITING, WHICH I THINK
00:57:41   FOR SOMETHING RUNNING IN THE WEB IS ACTUALLY
00:57:43   PRETTY AMAZING.
00:57:44   SO THAT'S THE GOOD.
00:57:46   IT COMES WITH A COST, HOWEVER.
00:57:48   SO THIS METRIC IS MEASURING THE SIZE OF THE
00:57:53   AMOUNT OF JAVASCRIPT THAT YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD TO
00:57:55   RUN THIS THING.
00:57:57   AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN READ THAT ON THE
00:57:59   GRAPH HERE BUT AS A GENERAL RULE, WHEN YOU'RE
00:58:02   MEASURING THE SIZE OF YOUR JAVASCRIPT ASSETS IN
00:58:05   MEGABYTES, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME ON THE
00:58:08   WEB, RIGHT?
00:58:10   PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THIS IS, YOU
00:58:13   KNOW, ENSCRIPTIN IS DESIGNED FOR GAMES AND IN A
00:58:17   GAME, IT'S OKAY TO SHOW A LOADING GAME, I'M
00:58:20   LOADING A COUPLE OF GIG OF ASSETS, YOU DON'T CARE
00:58:24   ABOUT JAVASCRIPT.
00:58:25   BUT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU WOULD LIKE TO
00:58:27   LOAD IT FASTER.
00:58:28   THERE IS INTERESTING NOW WORK GOING ON INSIDE
00:58:30   ENSCRIPTIN THAT WILL MAKE THIS SMALLER AND I
00:58:33   THINK FOR DOING STUFF INSIDE PYPY.
00:58:36   SO THAT WILL BE PUSHING FORWARD ON THIS YEAR.
00:58:39   THIS IS MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT
00:58:40   JAVASCRIPT I JUST SHOWED YOU, BASICALLY THE JS
00:58:43   MODULE, SO MEASURING THE OVERHEAD OF DOING LIKE
00:58:46   DOM MANIPULATION IN PYPY INSTEAD OF IN NATIVE
00:58:50   JAVASCRIPT AND EVEN IF I TAKE CHROME OUT OF THE
00:58:53   EQUATION, WE'RE TALKING HUNDREDS OF TIMES IS
00:58:56   SLOWER THAN DOG IT NENÊ ACTIVELY IN JAVASCRIPT,
00:59:01   WHICH IS NOT AWESOME.
00:59:02   I THINK, SOMEWHAT NAIVELY, THAT CAN CAN BE
00:59:05   DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED BY TEACHING THE PYPY JIT
00:59:09   ABOUT JAVASCRIPT, MORE ABOUT JAVASCRIPT, RIGHT?
00:59:11   BUT RIGHT NOW, IT'S KIND OF SLOW.
00:59:14   SO YOU CAN DO FUN DEMOS AND STUFF BUT IF YOU WERE
00:59:16   DOING LIKE SERIOUS DOM MANIPULATION, YOU'RE DOING
00:59:19   TO PAY A PERFORMANCE PENALTY.
00:59:20   SO IF I RETURN TO THE KIND OF QUESTION I HAD AT
00:59:23   THE START, ALL RIGHT, CAN WE HIT THIS MIDDLE
00:59:28   GROUND?
00:59:28   I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP HERE AND SAY,
00:59:30   BAM, PYPY TO JS, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THERE,
00:59:33   TICKING ALL THREE BOXES.
00:59:34   YOU PROBABLY ARE NOT GOING TO BE CONVINCED AFTER
00:59:36   SEEING THOSE METRICS, RIGHT?
00:59:38   HONESTLY, IT PLACES CLOSER TO HERE.
00:59:41   IT'S A REALLY COMPATIBLE, PRETTY FAST PYTHON
00:59:44   ENVIRONMENT THAT RUNS IN THE WEB AND STARTING TO
00:59:46   PUSH INTO KIND OF BEING REALLY OF THE WEB.
00:59:49   BUT IF YOU TAKE THAT HIGH END AND TRY TO DO LIKE
00:59:53   SCRIPTING THE INTERACTIONS ON YOUR WEBSITE,
00:59:55   PROBABLY GOING TO BE A BIT SLOW RIGHT NOW.
00:59:57   THAT SAID, I THINK, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A WILL THE
01:00:00   OF GROUND FOR PUSHING -- A LOT OF GROUNDS FOR
01:00:03   PUSHING FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO THAT MIDDLE
01:00:05   GROUND SO BE REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT WE
01:00:07   CAN COME UP WITH OVER THE COMING YEAR.
01:00:09   OKAY.
01:00:09   SO, QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE ON YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW
01:00:12   IS, WHY?
01:00:13   GOOD, THANK YOU, AT LEAST SOMEONE DOES.
01:00:16   SO MY THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY
01:00:19   SUMMED UP BY THIS SATURDAY MORNING BREAKFAST
01:00:21   CEREAL CARTOON.
01:00:22   WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU WHY, THEY KINDS OF EXPECT
01:00:24   YOU TO RESPONDS LIKE THIS, WHY IS THIS THING
01:00:26   IMPORTANT?
01:00:27   OH, IT HAS LOTS OF REALLY EXCELLENT APPLICATIONS
01:00:29   IN, LIKE, ENERGY AND SO FORTH.
01:00:33   I'M A LOT MORE LIKE THIS GUY, SO I CENSORED IT
01:00:38   FOR THE CONTENTS, BECAUSE ITS IT'S AWESOME, FUN,
01:00:41   I WANT TO DO AMAZING STUFF, RIGHTS?
01:00:43   THAT SAID, IT IS ALSO -- LIKE IT ALSO CAN BE
01:00:47   USEFUL.
01:00:48   SO AS I SAID, LIKE THE FIRST THING PEOPLE TEND TO
01:00:50   WANT TO DO IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS, RIGHT?
01:00:53   WRITE SCRIPT TEXT EQUALS PYTHON AND I WANT TO
01:00:56   REITERATE ONE THING I SAID EARLIER ON IN THE
01:00:58   TALK, IF YOU TRY TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW TODAY, YOUR
01:01:01   USERS WILL NOT WANT TO DOWNLOAD IN OUR OR FIVE
01:01:04   MEG OF ASSETS TO INTERACT.
01:01:06   THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BAD TIME.
01:01:08   THAT SAID, THE LOAD TIME OF YOUR SITE IS NOT
01:01:11   ALWAYS IN THE CRITICAL PATH SO, FOR EXAMPLE, NONE
01:01:13   OF YOU HAD TO SIT AROUND WAITING FOR MY SLIDES TO
01:01:16   LOADS, SO IF I SCROLL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, I
01:01:18   SCRIPTED A BUNCH OF MY SLIDES LOGIC AS A SCRIPT
01:01:23   TYPE TEXT EQUALS PYTHON.
01:01:25   SIGHT WORKS, JUST BAD START-OUT BEHAVIOR SO BE
01:01:27   INTERESTING TO SEE HOW USEFUL WE CAN MAKE THAT.
01:01:30   FOLLOWING IN THAT THEME -- SORRY.
01:01:31   IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT TODAY, LIKE YOU SHOULD
01:01:34   PROBABLY CHECK OUT ONE OF THE ALTERNATE PROJECTS.
01:01:36   I HOPE TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH THEM SOMETIME THIS
01:01:38   YEAR, BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR SCRIPTING TAGS ON THE
01:01:41   WEB, PROBABLY CHECK ONE OF THESE OUT.
01:01:44   I DO WANT TO TRY TO DO SOME OTHER INTERESTING
01:01:47   STUFF, RIGHT?
01:01:48   PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THINGS LIKE PY 2 XE, WHERE YOU
01:01:53   CAN BUNDLE IT UP AND DISTRICT IT.
01:01:56   CAN WE USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO DEVELOP A PY TO
01:01:59   WEB?
01:01:59   PUT IT ON THE WEB AND IT RUNS WITHOUT ANY EXTRA
01:02:02   WORK, RIGHT?
01:02:02   CAN YOU THEN TAKE SOMETHING LIKE -- I CAN WIPE
01:02:08   OUT THE MANIFEST AND YOU HAVE AN INSTALLABLE
01:02:11   FIREFOX S APPLICATION, RIGHT, SO YOU CAN REACH
01:02:15   SOME -- SMARTPHONE MARKET WITH YOUR APP.
01:02:18   IF YOU RUN THAT THROUGH OUR AP K FACTORY, YOU CAN
01:02:24   TUNE THE FIREPOKES S AUTOPSY INTO AN ANDROID APP
01:02:27   AND REACH ONE OR TWO MORE PERCENT OF THE
01:02:29   SMARTPHONE WHYSER BASE.
01:02:30   THE OTHER -- USER BASE.
01:02:32   IT IS OTHER THING THAT PEOPLE HAVE GOING ON
01:02:34   THAT'S INTERESTING LIKE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY
01:02:36   DO A GREAT STUFF WITH PYTHON ON THE WEB WHERE THE
01:02:39   START-UP COSTS MAY NOT BE A DEAL-BREAKER SO CAN
01:02:42   WE GET MORE NEW ENGINEER -- NUMERIC STUFF INSIDE
01:02:46   PIPE AYE, CAN WE USE ENSCRIPTIN AND STITCH INTO
01:02:51   THIS INTO A FULL-BASED SCRIPTING PLATFORM, FUN
01:02:55   STUFF LIKE THAT.
01:02:55   I WANT TO CALL OUT EXPLICITLY THE POSSIBILITY OF
01:02:59   GETTING FREE STUFF.
01:02:59   SO YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I LEAVE THAT AS A
01:03:03   BAD -- NEVER MIND -- THAT I'VE BEEN RUNNING IN
01:03:07   PYTHON2.
01:03:09   PYTHON2, BECAUSE PYPY SUPPORTS PYTHON, 12 BY
01:03:15   DEFAULTS.
01:03:16   I WANT PYTHON 3 ON THE WEB.
01:03:17   I GO AND CHECK OUT THIS BRANCH OF THE REAPER AND
01:03:21   SUDDENLY, I'VE GOT PYTHON 3, ESSENTIALLY FOR FREE
01:03:24   RUNNING IN THE WEB.
01:03:25   IF PYTHON TURNS OUT TO BE NOT QUITE YOUR THING,
01:03:28   YOU CAN GO DO THIS REPO AND CHECK IT OUT.
01:03:31   ANYONE WHO DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THAT WEIRD PROMPT,
01:03:33   THIS IS A PROLOGUE ENGINE AND IT'S A PROPER ONE,
01:03:35   TOO.
01:03:36   IF I ASK IT TO SOLVE FOR A AND B, IT WILL TELL ME
01:03:39   AN ANSWER, THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, IT WILL TELL
01:03:41   ME OTHER ONE, SO ON.
01:03:44   IT RUNS IN THE WEB AND JITS TO JAVASCRIPT AT
01:03:46   RUNTIME AND I GOT ALL OF THAT FOR FREE.
01:03:48   THIS WORKED LITERALLY THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT.
01:03:50   >> I CHECKED OUT THE REPO AND PUT IT ON THE WEB,
01:03:53   SO THE REASON I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS APPROACH
01:03:55   IS I THINK IT REALLY OPENS UP IT IS POSSIBILITY
01:03:57   OF GETTING A LOT MORE STUFF ON TO THE WEB ONCE WE
01:04:01   PUT IN THE INITIAL WORK.
01:04:02   SO LET ME CONCLUDE BY SIMPLY SAYING, I WOULD LOVE
01:04:06   TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ADOPT THIS ATTITUDE OF
01:04:09   FOLLOWING BUGS AGAINST THE WEB.
01:04:10   WE REALLY SHOULDN'T SETTLE FOR THE WEB AS A
01:04:13   SECOND CLASS COMPUTING PLATFORM AND IF THIS TURNS
01:04:15   OUT TO BE A FAILED EXPERIMENT FOR WANT OF A
01:04:17   VARIETY OF REASONS, AND ALL I'VE MANAGED TO DO IS
01:04:21   IDENTIFY SOME BUGS IN THE WEB, THIS FAILED
01:04:23   BECAUSE THE WEB SUCKS AT X,  J, Z, THAT WILL BE A
01:04:26   SUCCESS FOR ME AND I WANT TO TRY AND INSPIRE
01:04:28   PEOPLE TO ASK MORE OF THE WEB AND HOPEFULLY WE
01:04:31   CAN START TREATING IT AS A FIRST-CLASS COMPUTING
01:04:34   PLATFORM RIGHT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF
01:04:36   ENGINEERING.
01:04:37   SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
01:04:39   HOPEFULLY I'VE LEFT SOME TIME FOR QUESTIONS.
01:04:41   [ Applause ]
01:04:47
01:04:51   >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, RYAN.
01:04:52   WE DO HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND I BELIEVE THERE
01:04:54   IS A MIC BACK HERE, SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
01:04:57   PLEASE COME ASK THEM.
01:05:00   >> HAVE YOU TRIED IT ON NODE?
01:05:03   YES.
01:05:06   *
01:05:06   >> YES.
01:05:07   YOU CAN ACTUALLY MPM INSTALL THIS THING, I
01:05:10   HAVEN'T PUBLISHED THE LATEST VERSION BUT YOU CAN,
01:05:12   AND IT'S EASIER THERE BECAUSE OF A VARIETIES OF
01:05:14   THINGS WITH THE WAY INSCRIPTING WORKS.
01:05:16   ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE IS
01:05:19   RUNNING A WYJS APP UNDER NODE, TO SEE IF IT'S
01:05:23   POSSIBLE, JUST FOR FUN.
01:05:26   >> AUDIENCE:  SO THERE'S BEEN TWO HISTORICAL
01:05:29   PROJECTS IN PYPY, ONE IS TO USE CLAIM AND...
01:05:33   [ Audio Indiscernible ]
01:05:34   AND THEY FAILED FOR WHATEVER REASON, AND THERE
01:05:37   WAS ALSO A JAVASCRIPT BACK IN THE DIOD.
01:05:42   DID YOU LOOK AT THOSE, WERE YOU ABLE TO REUSE
01:05:44   ANYTHING?
01:05:45   >> SO THE QUESTION WAS ESSENTIALLY THERE HAVE
01:05:47   BEEN LMVM BACK ENDS AND JAVA BACK ENDS FOR
01:05:53   JAVASCRIPT IN THE PAST AND DID I LOOK AT THEM AND
01:05:56   LEARN ANYTHING.
01:05:56   I DID BRIEFLY.
01:05:57   MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE SORT OF MORE OR
01:06:01   LESS PREDATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN
01:06:03   ENSCRIPTIN, RIGHT, SO THE ORIGINAL JAVASCRIPT
01:06:06   BACK IN PYPY WAS TRYING TO TARGETS MORE OR LESS
01:06:09   JAVASCRIPT, LIKE JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS AND SORT OF
01:06:12   MORE LIKE THE JAVASCRIPT THAT YOU WRITE BY HAND.
01:06:14   I THINK IT WAS EVENTUALLY ABANDONED AND RIPPED
01:06:17   OUT AND DECLARED TO BE A TERRIBLE IDEA AND I
01:06:19   AGREE BECAUSE PYTHON KNOT JAVASCRIPT.
01:06:21   THE REASON I SORT OF DIDN'T HESITATE TO START
01:06:25   THIS IS THAT THIS KIND OF SMJS AND ENSCRIPTIN,
01:06:29   THE WEB AS A 32-PIT CPU IS PRETTY NEW SO IT
01:06:33   BRINGS WITH IT A DIFFERENT SET OF CAPABILITIES
01:06:34   AND TRADE-OFFS THAT SEEM TO BE WORKING OUT OKAY
01:06:36   IN PRACTICE.
01:06:42   >> AUDIENCE: HI.
01:06:43   I'M CURIOUS, A FEW YEARS AGO, I WROTE JUST FOR
01:06:47   SEVERAL REASONS A -- OUT OF THE PYTHON
01:06:50   INTERPRETER, I WROTE A PYTHON PACKAGE I WAS ABLE
01:06:54   TO INTERACT WITH THE JAVASCRIPT CORE ENGINE AND
01:06:56   AT THAT POINT IT WAS WEB KIT JTTK WAS THE EASIEST
01:07:00   THING I COULD USE TO BRING UP A BROWSER THROUGH
01:07:02   PYTHON.
01:07:03   I WAS ABLE TO WRITE CODE THAT WAS DIRECTLY ABLE
01:07:05   TO INTERACT WITH JSON BEING AND THAT CAN INTERACT
01:07:09   WITH THE PYTHON CODES.
01:07:10   I'M WONDERING WHY DON'T WE EXPLORE OPTIONS OF
01:07:14   PUTTING A PYTHON INTERPRETER INTO THE BROWSER AND
01:07:17   USE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WOULD RUN THINGS EVEN
01:07:18   FASTER THAN JAVASCRIPT BECAUSE IT'S RUNNING
01:07:21   DIRECT PYTHON INTERPRETER IN THE BROWSER ITSELF,
01:07:24   WITHOUT THE -- AND ACTUALLY CAN INTERACT WITH ANY
01:07:27   JAVASCRIPT AT ALL THAT YOU PUT INTO THE WEB PAGE.
01:07:29   >> I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.
01:07:32   THE DIFFICULTY IS NO ONE IS CAPABLE OF DOING THAT
01:07:35   THEMSELVES, RIGHT?
01:07:36   SO, I MEAN, GOOGLE AND CHROME ESSENTIALLY WANTED
01:07:40   TO DO THE SAME THING, THIS IS A BETTER LANGUAGE
01:07:43   THAN JAVASCRIPT, WE WANT TO SLIP THIS NATIVELY TO
01:07:46   THE WEB AND DESPITE KIND OF THE CLOUT THEY HAVE
01:07:49   WITH CHROME, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT.
01:07:52   AND SO IT'S NOT KIND OF WITHIN ANY ONE WEB
01:07:55   VENDOR'S PALLOR TO TRY TO FORCE THIS FORWARD ON
01:07:59   THE WEB AND IF WE SHIP FIREFOX -- WE SHIP PYTHON
01:08:02   INSIDE FIREFOX, NOBODY'S GOING TO USE IT BECAUSE
01:08:05   IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN CHROME, NOT AVAILABLE IN
01:08:08   INTERNET EXPLORER.
01:08:09   MY KIND OF SECRET HOPE IS THAT WE CAN SHIP THIS
01:08:13   KIND OF JAVASCRIPT SHENANIGANS AS A FALL-BACK.
01:08:17   SO IF A BROWSER WAS ABLE TO SHIP A NATIVE
01:08:19   IMPLEMENTATION OF A LANGUAGE, THEN YOU COULD USE
01:08:21   IT ABOUT THE IF THEY'RE NOT, THEN IT'S OKAY TO
01:08:23   FALL BACK TO THIS KIND OF COMPILED JAVASCRIPT
01:08:25   IMPLEMENTATION.
01:08:26   THAT'S ONE POTENTIAL WAY TO KIND OF BUILD UP
01:08:29   COLLABORATIVELY OUT OF, YOU KNOW, THE SITUATION
01:08:32   WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS WHAT'S KIND OF
01:08:34   THREE-WAY MEXICAN STAND-OFF WHERE NO BROWSER
01:08:36   VENDOR WANTS TO -- OR EVERY BROWSER VENDOR WANTS
01:08:39   TO IMPROVE STUFF BUT IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
01:08:42   >> AUDIENCE:  SO ONE USE CASE THAT WE'VE USED
01:08:47   iPYTHON NOTEBOOK FOR IS HELPING PEOPLE LEARN
01:08:50   PYTHON FROM THE BEGINNING, INTRODUCING THEM TO
01:08:52   THE SYNTAX AND HOW IT MAKES THINGS FEEL WITHOUT
01:08:55   THE BURDEN OF SETTING UP THEIR SYSTEMS BUT
01:08:57   OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS SOMEONE HAS TO
01:08:59   RUN THE iPYTHON NOTEBOOK SOMEWHERE AND THAT
01:09:01   SYSTEM IS BASICALLY INSECURE.
01:09:03   SO YOU ALLUDED TO THIS BUT I'M CURIOUS WHO'S
01:09:07   WORKING ON IT OR WHAT STATE IS IT IN, THE LOAD
01:09:11   TIME WILL BE LARGE BUT IN THIS CONTEXT, THAT'S
01:09:13   OKAY, THEY LOADED UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY
01:09:15   AND THEN -- I MEAN, EVEN JUST USING -- EVEN JUST
01:09:20   USING THE SORT OF EXAMPLE THAT YOU'RE SHOWING
01:09:23   WOULD BE GREAT BUT HOW IS THE WORK GOING,
01:09:25   PROGRESSING WITH COMBINING IT WITH iPYTHON
01:09:28   NOTEBOOK AND IS THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN
01:09:29   AND...
01:09:30   IS IT PRODUCTION-READY FOR THOSE SORT OF
01:09:33   PURPOSES?
01:09:33   OR EVEN YOUR OWN LIBRARY BEING READY FOR
01:09:36   PRODUCTION PURPOSES.
01:09:37   >> SO PART OF THE REASON I PUT THAT MENTION OF
01:09:39   iPYTHON ON MY SLIDES IS I WOULD LOVE TO FIND
01:09:41   SOMEONE HERE AT THE CONFERENCE WHO'S INTERESTED
01:09:43   IN THAT AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.
01:09:45   I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYONE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT
01:09:47   NOW, I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE COOL.
01:09:49   I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE -- LIKE THE iPYTHON
01:09:52   STUFF IS REALLY WELL FACTORED, GOT EXCELLENT KIND
01:09:55   OF PROTOCOLS FOR DOING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE
01:09:57   FRONT END AND ENGINES AND SO FORTH, SO I THINK IT
01:10:00   WOULD PROBABLY COME TOGETHER QUITE NICELY BUT I
01:10:02   DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF KNOWLEDGE OR TIME TO BUILD
01:10:04   IT MYSELF.
01:10:05   I WOULD LOVE TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE.
01:10:07   IF SOMEONE IS INTERESTED IN TRYING TO PLUG THIS
01:10:09   INTO iPYTHON NOTEBOOK AND SO FORTH, LET'S
01:10:13   CONNECT SOMEHOW AT THIS CONFERENCE BECAUSE I
01:10:14   THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT.
01:10:19   >> AGAIN, RYAN, LET'S GIVE RYAN A ROUND OF
01:10:22   APPLAUSE.
01:10:22   >> THANK YOU.
01:10:23   [ Applause ]
01:10:28   [ END OF SESSION ]
