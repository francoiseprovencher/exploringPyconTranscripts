09:51:39  >>  HELLO, EVERYONE.
09:51:40  OUR SPEAKER TODAY IS LVH.
09:51:44  DISCRETE LOGS IN CHARACTERISTICS, AND HE'S
09:51:46  GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT BUILDING SECURE
09:51:48  SOFTWARE.
09:51:48  PLEASE WELCOME HIM.
09:51:55  [ APPLAUSE ]
09:51:56  >> HI.
09:51:56  THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.
09:51:58  SO I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING
09:51:59  SECURE SYSTEMS, BUILDING SECURE SOFTWARE IN
09:52:01  PARTICULAR.
09:52:03  SO I'M LVH.
09:52:05  THAT'S MY TWITTER HANDLE.
09:52:07  IF YOU WANT TO EMAIL ME, IT'S AN ANYTHING
09:52:11  UNDERSCORE. LVH.
09:52:14  IT'S JUST BUILDING SECURE SOFTWARE.
09:52:19  A QUICK INTRODUCTION.
09:52:19  SO HI, I'M LVH.
09:52:23  I'M A CRYPTOGRAPHER.
09:52:25  WE'RE AT PYCON, I'M SURE YOU'VE GATHERED.
09:52:31  THERE'S A LOT OF SPECIAL FRIENDS THAT I ONLY
09:52:33  GET TO SEE ONCE A YEAR, AND PYCON IS THAT.
09:52:29  PYCON IS A SPECIAL TIME OF THE YEAR FOR ME.
09:52:36  THIS YEAR I HAVE TWO TALK SLOTS AND A COUPLE OF
09:52:38  STAFF POSITIONS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL AID, WHICH
09:52:40  IS THE NON-TRIVIAL WORK OF DISTRIBUTING ABOUT A
09:52:44  QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS TO ABOUT 330
09:52:46  PEOPLE.
09:52:46  THAT'S NOT BRAGGING.
09:52:47  THAT'S AN APOLOGY IN ADVANCE.
09:52:49  I'M RUNNING ON A SIGNIFICANT SLEEP DEFICIT.
09:52:52  WITH ANY LUCK, I'LL BE SOMEWHAT COHERENT.
09:52:56  I HAVE A DAY JOB.
09:52:57  I WORK AT RACKSPACE.
09:52:58  IT'S A COOL PLACE TO WORK.
09:53:00  WE'RE A SPONSOR.
09:53:01  YOU SHOULD COME UP TO THE BOOTH AND TALK TO US.
09:53:03  IN THIS TALK, I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.  I HAVE
09:53:06  SOME GOOD NEWS.  I'M GOING TO HAVE A META
09:53:10  CONVERSATION.
09:53:10  WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS WE
09:53:12  HAVE.
09:53:12  IN THIS TALK ARE COMMON SECURITY BUGS, WHAT
09:53:16  SOFTWARE TO USE OR STUFF LIKE THAT.
09:53:18  IT'S FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL, FAIRLY ABSTRACT.
09:53:25  SOFTWARE CONSISTENCY.
09:53:26  SO THE SOFTWARE IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.
09:53:21  THE HUMAN INTERACTIONS THAT END UP PRODUCING
09:53:29  ALL SOFTWARES HAVE BUGS.
09:53:30  SOME OF THOSE HAVE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS, AND
09:53:32  SECURITY BUGS ARE BAD.
09:53:33  I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH PRETTY MUCH ALL
09:53:35  OF THESE STATEMENTS.
09:53:36  THAT SOUNDS VERY PESSIMISTIC, BUT THIS TALK IS
09:53:39  REALLY A MESSAGE OF HOPE.
09:53:40  I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE GIVE UP.
09:53:42  I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE TRY TO ATTAIN
09:53:45  PERFECTION BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
09:53:47  HAPPEN, BUT I AM SUGGESTING THAT WE CAN DO
09:53:49  SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS AN INDUSTRY.
09:53:51  AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TO DO
09:53:53  SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS AN INDUSTRY.
09:53:54  SO UNFORTUNATELY, I'M GOING TO START WITH THE
09:53:57  BAD NEWS.
09:53:58  AND, QUITE FRANKLY, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY --
09:54:00  THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WONDER THAT EVERYTHING IS
09:54:02  BROKEN ALL OF THE TIME BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SO
09:54:05  MANY REASONS.
09:54:06  MOST OF OUR TOOLS THAT WE USE FOR DEVELOPING
09:54:09  SOFTWARE DON'T GENERALLY WORK WHEN IT COMES TO
09:54:11  A LOT OF CORPORATIONS MESS IT UP.
09:54:13  OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FAILS TO EDUCATE.  AND
09:54:11  SECURITY.
09:54:16  TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST.
09:54:18  IT'S VERY EASY TO FIND DIFFERENT SUBTLE WAYS
09:54:21  THAT STUFF IS BROKEN AND WHY IT'S BROKEN.
09:54:27  I MENTIONED THAT OUR TOOLS DON'T WORK.
09:54:28  SO SOMEWHAT FACETIOUSLY HOW DO I WRITE THE
09:54:32  UNION TEST FOR SECURITY.
09:54:33  RIGHT?
09:54:33  HOW DOES THAT WORK?
09:54:34  WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?
09:54:35  YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY DO THAT.
09:54:37  SO ASK YOURSELVES HOW DO WE LEARN SOFTWARE.
09:54:39  THERE IS SOME NEW SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT I'M
09:54:42  INTERESTED IN, AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS.
09:54:44  HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
09:54:46  USUALLY, WE READ DOCUMENTATION.
09:54:47  RIGHT?
09:54:47  HOPEFULLY.
09:54:49  AND THE PROBLEM WITH MOST SECURITY
09:54:51  DOCUMENTATION IS THAT IT'S LIKE MISSING OR
09:54:53  TERRIBLE.
09:54:53  MISSING IS ACTUALLY THE BETTER OPTION BECAUSE
09:54:55  MOST OF THE TERRIBLE DOCS JUST MISLEAD YOU, AND
09:54:59  NOT.
09:55:01  OH, SORRY.
09:54:58  YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT, AND YOU'RE
09:55:03  THE OTHER PROBLEM IS GOOGLE AND SITE OVERFLOW.
09:55:07  I DON'T WANT TO RANT ON GOOGLE OR SITE
09:55:08  OVERFLOW.
09:55:11  THEY ARE WONDERFUL TOOLS, BUT THE PROBLEM IS
09:55:13  THEY HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF MISINFORMATION.
09:55:14  THE OTHER PROBLEM AND THIS IS GOING TO COME
09:55:16  BACK NUMEROUS TIMES IS THE GOOD PRACTICE LOOKS
09:55:18  EXACTLY LIKE BAD PRACTICE.
09:55:20  AND TO MOST OF US, IT IS USUALLY
09:55:24  INDISTINGUISHABLE.
09:55:25  SO HOW ELSE DO WE LEARN ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S
09:55:29  NO DOCUMENTATION, RIGHT?
09:55:30  YOU PLAY WITH IT.
09:55:31  YOU INSTALL IT.
09:55:32  YOU LOOK AT THE CODE.
09:55:33  YOU OPEN UP A PYTHON REP.
09:55:36  YOU CREATE FROM OBJECTS, YOU PLAY WITH IT, YOU
09:55:38  HAVE A GOOD TIME, AND YOU REPEAT THE PROCESS.
09:55:41  AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU LEARN ENOUGH ABOUT THE
09:55:43  STUFF THAT YOU'RE USING.
09:55:44  AND YEAH, IT'S A GOOD TIME.
09:55:46  FORTUNATELY, SECURITY DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT
09:55:50  INFORMATION SECURITY WHEN YOU DO THE INSTALL
09:55:53  IT, PLAY WITH IT STEP,
09:55:48  WAY FOR VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING RELATED TO
09:55:56  THEN THE NEXT STEP IS GENERALLY GET IT WRONG,
09:55:58  AND THEN YOU REPEAT IT ANYWAY. AND THE PROBLEM
09:55:59  HERE -- I'M NOT SAYING LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
09:56:01  ALL DUMB, YOU'RE ALL GOING TO GET ALL THE
09:56:04  SECURITY STUFF WRONG.
09:56:05  THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
09:56:06  WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE DOCS ARE TERRIBLE.
09:56:08  THIS IS REALLY TRICKY.
09:56:10  AND DOING IT RIGHT IS EXACTLY LIKE DOING IT
09:56:12  WRONG.
09:56:12  SO IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
09:56:16  IT'S CORRECT.
09:56:16  IT DOES ALMOST WORK THAT WAY.
09:56:19  ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LEARN STUFF ABOUT
09:56:21  INFORMATION SECURITY IS TO TRY AND BREAK INTO
09:56:23  SYSTEMS.
09:56:24  AND THERE ARE PEOPLE AND COMPANIES THAT DO THIS
09:56:27  PROFESSIONALLY ALL OF THE TIME.
09:56:29  SO WHAT YOU COULD DO IS YOU CAN INSTALL SOME
09:56:31  SOFTWARE, TRY TO BREAK IT, YOU'LL PROBABLY
09:56:33  LEARN SOMETHING AND THEN YOU REPEAT.
09:56:35  AND USUALLY AFTER YOU BREAK SOMETHING HOPEFULLY
09:56:38  BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE GENERALLY NOT
09:56:41  TRAINED TO THINK THAT WAY.
09:56:37  YOU FIX IT AS WELL.
09:56:42  RIGHT?
09:56:43  YOUR JOB AS SOFTWARE ENGINEERS IS TO MAKE
09:56:45  SOMETHING WORK, NOT TO MAKE SOMETHING FAIL.
09:56:47  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT FAILURE IS
09:56:49  SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER.
09:56:50  RIGHT?
09:56:50  THERE'S USUALLY ONLY ONE WAY THAT SOMETHING CAN
09:56:53  WORK CORRECTLY, AND THERE'S BASICALLY LOTS OF
09:56:58  WAYS THAT SOMETHING CAN FAIL.
09:56:59  THE ISSUES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SUBTLE.
09:57:01  RIGHT?
09:57:01  YOU'RE NOT TESTING THE HAPPY PATH THAT THIS
09:57:05  PARSES SOMETHING CORRECTLY.
09:57:07  YOU'RE TESTING, IF AN ATTACKER TRIES TO GET ME
09:57:10  TO PARSE SOMETHING INCORRECTLY, WHAT COULD
09:57:12  POSSIBLY GO WRONG.
09:57:14  THE ANSWER IS LOTS.
09:57:16  ALSO, WE'RE NOT PAID TO THINK THAT WAY.
09:57:18  OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO
09:57:21  REGULARLY WRITE SOFTWARE.
09:57:22  SO FOR THOSE ON VIDEO, THAT IS EVERYONE.
09:57:25  WHO REGULARLY GETS TO DO PIN TESTING?
09:57:29  SO THAT'S LIKE MAYBE FIVE PEOPLE?
09:57:32  THAT'S BEING VERY GENEROUS.
09:57:27  WHO REGULARLY GETS TO -- OKAY.
09:57:34  THERE'S VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS.
09:57:36  GENEROUS, A DOZEN.
09:57:37  THERE'S A LOT MORE THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THIS
09:57:39  ROOM.
09:57:40  SO WE DON'T GET TO DO THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS.
09:57:44  AND ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF
09:57:45  CORPORATIONS MESS IT UP.
09:57:48  SOMEWHAT UNDERSTANDABLE.
09:57:50  A LOT OF NEW FEATURES ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN
09:57:52  FIXING SECURITY BUGS.
09:57:54  PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
09:57:56  THIS IS HUMAN NATURE.
09:57:57  THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
09:57:58  AND WHEN YOU DON'T SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF EFFORT
09:58:00  INTO TRYING TO PREVENT IT, YOU'RE -- SOME
09:58:03  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES, AND THEY'RE
09:58:05  GOING TO HIT PRODUCTION.
09:58:06  AGAIN, GOOD PRACTICE LOOKS JUST LIKE BAD
09:58:08  PRACTICE, SO IT'S NOT LIKE THESE THINGS ARE
09:58:10  EASY TO SPOT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT A
09:58:13  TRAINED INFORMATION SECURITY PERSON WHO
09:58:14  BASICALLY HAS AVAILED LARGE PARTS OF THEIR LIFE
09:58:20  ANOTHER THING IS THAT A LARGE, PUBLICLY-TRADED
09:58:21  COMPANY -- WHICH WILL NOT BE NAMED.  I'M NOT
09:58:18  TO SPOTTING THESE THINGS.
09:58:24  TRYING TO PICK ON ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY.
09:58:26  THE REASON I PICKED THIS ONE IS BECAUSE THEY
09:58:27  HAD VERY PUBLIC, VERY MEDIATIZED, VERY VISIBLE,
09:58:33  SEVERAL SECURITY INCIDENTS.
09:58:35  AND SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS A PARTICULAR
09:58:38  INCIDENT, THE PSP KEY LEAK THAT INVOLVED
09:58:41  GETTING A VERY BASIC CRYPTO PRIMITIVE VERY
09:58:48  WRONG.
09:58:48  AND A LARGE, BUNCH OF INFORMATION GOT LEAKED.
09:58:51  THIS IS THE MARKET CAP OF SAID COMPANY.
09:58:52  THE BLACK LINE IS THE ZERO LINE.
09:58:55  YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THESE ARE NOT COMPANY ENDING
09:58:58  EVENTS.
09:58:58  RIGHT?
09:58:59  SO YOU COULD ARGUE THAT FROM A PURELY MARKET
09:59:01  ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE THESE COMPANIES ARE BEING
09:59:04  ENTIRELY RATIONAL ACTORS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT
09:59:07  YOU CAN TOTALLY GET AWAY WITH IT.
09:59:09  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS ABSTINENCE ONLY EDUCATION.
09:59:12  SO WHAT DO WE TEACH?
09:59:14  FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WOULD THINK THAT OR
09:59:18  CONSIDER YOURSELF TO HAVE HAD FORMAL CS
09:59:23  COUPLE CS CLASSES IF COLLEGE, RIGHT?
09:59:27  HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF LISKOV
09:59:21  EDUCATION, SO LIKE AP CLASSES, OR YOU TOOK A
09:59:32  SUBSTITUTION.
09:59:32  A LOT.
09:59:33  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GLOBAL THING, BUT MOST
09:59:35  OF THE PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO -- THAT INCLUDES
09:59:37  MYSELF -- NOBODY LETS YOU WRITE THE WORD CLASS
09:59:39  INTO A TEXT EDITOR WITHOUT HAVING TALKED TO YOU
09:59:42  ABOUT WHAT LISKOV SUBSTITUTION IS.
09:59:46  THERE IS SOME FORMAL LOGIC THERE.
09:59:48  IT BASICALLY MEANS IF YOU HAVE A WIDGET, YOU
09:59:50  CAN REPLACE IT WITH A WIDGET OF THE ORIGINAL
09:59:53  SUBTYPE OF A WIDGET.
09:59:55  SO YOU CAN REPLACE THINGS WITH THEIR SUBCLASSES
09:59:57  OR SPECIALIZATIONS.
09:59:58  AND IT IS APPARENTLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE
10:00:00  THIS IS THE FIRST THING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT.
10:00:02  NOW, WHAT DON'T WE TEACH AND LEAST AUTHORITY?
10:00:06  THIS PRINCIPLE IS THAT YOU DON'T GIVE STUFF
10:00:10  MORE POWER THAN IT NEEDS.
10:00:13  A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE.
10:00:13  A LOT OF US WRITE PYTHON.
10:00:16  EVERY SINGLE PYTHON CODE THAT YOU CALL CAN
10:00:18  BASICALLY DO WHATEVER IT WANTS.
10:00:21  IT CAN READ STUFF.
10:00:23  CALLING SOME C LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME LIKE
10:00:20  IT CAN OPEN FILES.
10:00:26  CALLING SOME PYTHON WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT'S
10:00:28  DOING.
10:00:28  SO WE REALLY BESTOW A LOT OF AUTHORITY UPON
10:00:32  THINGS THAT AREN'T VERY WELL AUTHENTICATED.
10:00:38  NOW, THIS IS WHERE I DO THE EXTENSIVE HAND
10:00:41  WAVING BIT.
10:00:42  I DON'T MEAN TO HATE ON THE LISKOV PRINCIPLE.
10:00:47  IT IS A BASIC PIECE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE.
10:00:50  I'M NOT HITTING ON BARBARA LISKOV.
10:00:57  THAT IS NOT MY POINT.
10:00:58  WHAT I AM SAYING IS, AS AN INDUSTRY, WE WOULD
10:01:00  BE BETTER OFF IF WE STOPPED TALKING ABOUT --
10:01:02  WHENEVER WE SAID LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
10:01:06  AND INSTEAD TALKED ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE OF
10:01:08  AUTHORITY, I THINK WE WOULD BE IN BETTER SHAPE.
10:01:10  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT
10:01:12  IS INCREASINGLY SERVICING THE NEEDS OF A HUGE
10:01:15  AMOUNT OF PEOPLE, AND INCREASINGLY, THE
10:01:17  SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE ARE INCREASINGLY
10:01:19  GREAT.
10:01:20  YOU SHOULD GO TO GLIFKOWITZ TALK.
10:01:25  HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ETHICS OF ALL OF
10:01:28  THAT REALLY TIES INTO THE SAME THING.
10:01:30  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SECURITY IS NOT A
10:01:27  THIS.
10:01:32  PRIORITY.
10:01:32  IT IS NOT IN BUSINESS.
10:01:32  IT IS NOT IN EDUCATION.
10:01:34  SO THEREFORE, DON'T BE A JERK TO YOUR PEERS
10:01:36  ABOUT INFO TECH WHEN THEY GET IT WRONG.
10:01:40  DON'T BE A JERK.
10:01:41  STRAIGHT UP, DON'T.
10:01:43  GENERIC LIFE ADVICE RIGHT THERE.
10:01:45  SO THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS.
10:01:53  I'VE WORKED FOR A LONG TIME ON SOMETHING CALLED
10:01:55  CRYPTO 101.
10:01:58  YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT FOR FREE.
10:02:00  IT'S A BOOK CALLED CRYPTO 101.
10:02:05  THERE ARE WONDERFUL COMMUNITIES LIKE THE CRYPTO
10:02:08  COMMUNITY THAT SPEND A LOT OF TIME EDUCATING
10:02:11  PEOPLE.
10:02:11  MAYBE SOMEONE WITH FIX.EDU.
10:02:15  I DON'T KNOW.
10:02:15  IT'S NOT ME.
10:02:16  SOME TOOLS THAT WE HAVE DO ACTUALLY WORK
10:02:17  FORTUNATELY MOSTLY BY ACCIDENT.
10:02:20  SO AGAIN, CHANNELING GLIF.
10:02:25  ACT OF PROMOTING LOCAL UNDERSTANDING.
10:02:28  APPLY THAT TO SYSTEMS, THAT MEANS THAT SMALL
10:02:23  HE SAYS THAT PROGRAMMING IS NOTHING IF NOT THE
10:02:31  COMPOSED PIECES ARE PREFERABLE TO LARGE
10:02:33  MONOLITHS.
10:02:35  AND THIS IS A BROKEN SLIDE.
10:02:36  SO THERE IS NO IMPLICATIONS HERE.
10:02:39  I DID NOT SAY THAT IF YOU USE MICRO SERVICES
10:02:42  YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN SECURITY HAPPY LAND, AND
10:02:44  I DID NOT SAY IF YOU'RE OPERATING A MONOLITHIC
10:02:47  SERVICE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SECURITY
10:02:50  PROBLEMS.
10:02:50  CAN BE ALL SORTS OF STUFF CREWING FUNCTIONS,
10:02:53  CLASSES AND YES SERVICES TOO, BUT ARBITRARY
10:02:56  STUFF CAN MAKE STUFF WORSE.
10:02:58  ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE HAVE NOT JUST FOR SECURITY
10:03:01  BUT CAN HELP IS CURRENT  REVIEW.
10:03:04  IT'S THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR PROJECT
10:03:07  AFTER BUG TRACKER.
10:03:09  IT HELPS YOU CULTIVATE A CULTURE OF QUALITY.
10:03:11  IF YOU KNOW THAT YOUR STUFF IS GOING TO BE
10:03:14  SCRUTINIZED, THEN PROBABLY YOU'RE GOING TO
10:03:16  SPEND MORE TIME CLEANING IT UP.
10:03:18  FINALLY, THE ADVERSARIAL APPROACH THAT I TALKED
10:03:21  ABOUT, THE WAY THAT YOU FIX [INAUDIBLE] IS
10:03:25  THIS IS ALSO THE WAY YOU MAKE THESE RELIABLE.
10:03:29  YOU TRY AND GET THEM TO FAIL MERCILESSLY, AND
10:03:23  BREAK INTO THEM MERCILESSLY.
10:03:32  YOU DON'T STOP UNTIL YOU'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO
10:03:34  MAKE IT FAIL.
10:03:34  YOU CAN DO THAT IN-HOUSE.
10:03:35  YOU CAN DO THAT WITH THIRD PARTY AUDITS.
10:03:37  THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING MOST COMPANIES EXCEPT
10:03:41  MAYBE HEAD COUNT FROM HAVING PEOPLE WHOSE JOB
10:03:45  IT IS TO PROFESSIONALLY BREAK INTO THEIR OWN
10:03:49  PRODUCT.
10:03:50  HOW DO YOU WRITE CODE FOR SECURITY?
10:03:53  THERE IS A LOT OF AUTOMATED TESTING THAT YOU
10:03:55  CAN DO.
10:03:55  FOR EXAMPLE, MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE IS CERTIFICATE
10:03:58  TESTING.
10:03:58  SO BASICALLY UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO --
10:04:00  AND LET'S BE HONEST -- EVEN TO THIS DAY
10:04:02  BASICALLY TO WRITE SOFTWARE.  THE WORLD
10:04:03  ACTUALLY CHECKS YOUR CERTIFICATES CORRECTLY
10:04:06  BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLY HARD.
10:04:08  IT IS VERY EASY OR AT LEAST IT'S TRACKABLE.
10:04:11  LET ME HEDGE THAT A LITTLE BIT.
10:04:13  TO WRITE A TEST WHERE IF YOU HAVE SOME SOFTWARE
10:04:15  THAT DOESN'T TOS, CREATE A FAKE SERVER WITH A
10:04:22  WILL REFUSE TO CONNECT TO THAT THING AND BE
10:04:25  VERY, VERY SURPRISED WHEN IT ACTUALLY, TOTALLY,
10:04:20  FAKE CERTIFICATE AND ASSERT THAT YOUR SOFTWARE
10:04:27  HAPPILY THINKS THAT THAT SPACE IS GOOGLE OR
10:04:30  RACKSPACE OR WHATEVER.
10:04:31  AND I MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT CORPORATIONS
10:04:33  MESSING IT UP.
10:04:34  NO, NOT ALL CORPORATIONS MESS IT UP.
10:04:37  SOME EMPLOYERS ARE GREAT.
10:04:40  THERE ARE LOTS OF GREAT PLACES WORKING FOR THE
10:04:42  PUBLIC GOOD THAT HAVE LARGE TEAMS WORKING
10:04:45  FULL-TIME, VERY CLEVER PEOPLE.
10:04:47  AT OROKU, GOOGLE.
10:04:50  I'M PROBABLY GOING TO MISS A COUPLE.
10:04:53  RACKSPACE IS ONE OF THEM.
10:04:54  WE HAVE PEOPLE EMPLOYED FULL-TIME TO DO THIS
10:04:57  KIND OF STUFF.
10:04:57  THIS DOESN'T FIX OUR SYSTEMIC INDUSTRY KIND OF
10:05:02  STUFF.
10:05:02  IT'S HELPING, BUT CLEARLY, WE'RE NOT DONE.
10:05:05  RIGHT?
10:05:07  I TALKED ABOUT SOME GOOD NEWS.
10:05:10  TALKED ABOUT SOME BAD NEWS.
10:05:12  NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS
10:05:13  THAT WE HAVE.
10:05:17  THAN I AM, ZUKO.
10:05:20  HE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER.
10:05:14  SO CHANNELING ANOTHER PERSON WHO IS WAY SMARTER
10:05:21  AND HE SAYS THAT SECURITY IS NOT ABOUT PERFECT
10:05:24  VERSUS IMPERFECT.
10:05:25  IT IS NOT ABOUT BETTER VERSUS WORSE.
10:05:26  IT IS ABOUT THIS ATTACK SURFACE VERSUS THAT
10:05:31  ATTACK SURFACE.
10:05:32  THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE TO EXPLAIN SOME
10:05:34  VOCABULARY, BECAUSE ATTACK SERVICE IF YOU ARE
10:05:37  SURFACE, IS ALL THE WAYS THAT CAN ATTACK YOU OR
10:05:41  POTENTIALLY GET ON THE INSIDE.
10:05:46  THE OTHER WORD IS THREAT MODEL.
10:05:48  HOW WILL IT ATTACK THE SYSTEM?
10:05:53  DESCRIBE HOW YOU THINK THAT -- WHAT ARE THEY
10:05:54  ACTUALLY GOING TO DO TO GET INSIDE THE WALL?
10:05:58  NOW, A LOT OF SECURITY PROPOSALS IN MY OPINION
10:06:00  ARE BASICALLY USELESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY
10:06:04  COMMUNICATE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO.
10:06:06  IN MY OPINION, THE GOOD SECURITY PROPOSAL
10:06:08  REQUIRES A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS, INCLUDING A
10:06:11  DESCRIPTION, A THREAT MODEL, A MOTIVATION FOR
10:06:13  THAT THREAT MODEL, WHO THIS AFFECTS, THE THREAT
10:06:17  SERVICE.
10:06:19  SO YOU NEED A VERY PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT
10:06:22  I'VE SEEN LIKE LOTS OF ISSUE TRACKERS HAVE
10:06:24  SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WE'RE GOING TO USE
10:06:21  YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
10:06:26  SECURE COOKIES.
10:06:27  I CAN THINK OF LIKE AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT
10:06:29  CLASSES OF THINGS THAT THAT MEANS, AND EACH OF
10:06:32  THOSE HAVE TOTALLY BROKEN AND TOTALLY GOOD
10:06:36  IMPLEMENTATIONS -- OR AT LEAST ALL OF THEM HAVE
10:06:39  BROKEN IMPLEMENTATIONS.
10:06:40  IN PARTICULAR, IN SECURITY, THE DEVIL IS IN THE
10:06:43  DETAILS.
10:06:43  THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IF YOU DO THIS SLIGHTLY
10:06:45  DIFFERENT, IT MEANS YOUR ENTIRE THING DIDN'T
10:06:47  ACTUALLY WORK.
10:06:48  SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE A CONCRETE
10:06:50  DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO
10:06:51  DO, OTHERWISE NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
10:06:53  TALKING ABOUT.
10:06:54  THEN YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR THREAT MODEL.
10:06:57  WHAT ARE YOU PROTECTING AGAINST?
10:06:59  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE WALL AND SOMEBODY
10:07:00  TRYING TO GET IN, WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC ACTION
10:07:02  THAT IS NO LONGER GOING TO BE POSSIBLE AND HOW
10:07:04  IS THIS ADDRESSED NOW, AND IS IT NOT ADDRESSED
10:07:06  AT ALL.
10:07:09  REALLY WORK.
10:07:10  HOW WILL IT BE ADDRESSED AFTERWARDS?
10:07:07  MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE, BUT IT DOESN'T
10:07:11  THEN YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN
10:07:15  ATTACK SURFACE.
10:07:17  THE THING IS A LOT OF STUFF IS NOT ACTUALLY A
10:07:19  STRICT IMPROVEMENT.
10:07:20  THINK ABOUT IT.
10:07:21  LET'S SAY THAT -- SO THE EXAMPLE HERE IS SOME
10:07:24  MONITORING SOFTWARE.
10:07:25  SO YOU HAVE SOFTWARE THAT MONITORS PROCESSES
10:07:27  AND SOMETHING ON A SERVER SOMEWHERE.
10:07:30  NOW, THAT THING REQUIRES A LOT OF PRIVILEGES
10:07:34  BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT A LOT OF
10:07:36  OTHER STUFF.
10:07:37  WHEN YOU ADD THAT PIECE OF SOFTWARE, YOU HAVE
10:07:38  TO KEEP IN MIND WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S BUGS IN
10:07:40  THAT SOFTWARE.
10:07:41  RIGHT?
10:07:41  AND JUST BECAUSE I'M ADDING SOMETHING THAT
10:07:43  MIGHT BE PREVENTING SOME PROBLEMS DOESN'T MEAN
10:07:45  THAT I'M NOT ALSO ADDING SOMETHING THAT OPENS
10:07:49  OTHER DOORS AND ENABLES OTHER PROBLEMS.
10:07:52  AND FINALLY, THE USER EXPERIENCE WHICH IS
10:07:54  BASICALLY VERY OFTEN BEING FORGOTTEN ABOUT.
10:08:00  AND THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
10:08:02  ASPECTS, RIGHT?
10:07:57  I AM LOOKING AT UGGP, SO.
10:08:03  BECAUSE YOU COULD SAY THINGS ALONG THE LINE OF
10:08:05  IT TURNS OUT -- WE LOOKED AT ALL THE ATTACKERS
10:08:07  OUR COMPANY HAS EVER GONE THROUGH.
10:08:10  IT TURNS OUT ALL OF THEM COME THROUGH A THING
10:08:12  CALLED THE INTERNET.
10:08:13  HOW ABOUT WE TURN OFF THE INTERNET, RIGHT?
10:08:16  THAT DOESN'T WORK.
10:08:17  PEOPLE NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS, AND OBVIOUSLY,
10:08:19  I'M BEING A LITTLE BIT FACETIOUS BUT NOT
10:08:22  REALLY.
10:08:22  A LOT OF US WORK AT COMPANIES WITH RESTRICTIVE
10:08:25  FIREWALLS.
10:08:25  VERY OFTEN THEY DON'T ACTUALLY FIX ANY SECURITY
10:08:28  PROBLEMS, BUT, MAN, DO THEY MAKE YOUR LIFE
10:08:29  HARD.
10:08:30  TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THREAT MODELS,
10:08:34  I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE
10:08:37  AND SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT BASICALLY
10:08:38  EVERYONE HERE WILL BE SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH.
10:08:41  SMART PHONES.
10:08:42  FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, SMARTPHONES BASICALLY
10:08:45  CONTAIN EVERYTHING.
10:08:48  EMAIL, AND EMAIL HAS EVERYTHING.
10:08:51  CLEARLY, THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED.
10:08:45  YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOUR SMARTPHONE HAS YOUR
10:08:52  RIGHT?
10:08:52  THERE'S A LOT OF VERY, VERY SENSITIVE
10:08:54  INFORMATION ON ALMOST EVERYONE'S SMARTPHONE.
10:08:57  AND THE WAY WE PROTECT SMARTPHONES IS WITH LOCK
10:09:00  SCREENS.
10:09:01  AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT NO LOCK
10:09:04  SCREEN IS OBVIOUSLY WORSE THAN ANY LOCK SCREEN,
10:09:07  ANY LOCK SCREEN NO MATTER HOW -- LIKE HOW
10:09:10  INEFFECTIVE IT IS, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE
10:09:14  BETTER THAN NO LOCK SCREEN AT ALL.
10:09:16  I HAVE AN IPHONE 6.
10:09:17  IT'S VIBRATING A LOT.
10:09:19  I DON'T KNOW WHY.
10:09:19  AND I HAVE TWO OPTIONS, A PASS CODE AND A
10:09:22  FINGERPRINT.
10:09:23  ON SOME OTHER PHONES, YOU HAVE PATTERNS,
10:09:28  ANDROID, SAME THING WITH FACE RECOGNITION.
10:09:30  NOW, A PATTERN IS FUNDAMENTALLY A SECRET.
10:09:34  FACE RECOGNITION IS VIA METRICS.
10:09:36  IT'S LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE AS A
10:09:38  PHYSICAL PERSON, SO IT'S MORE OR LESS THE SAME
10:09:40  THING AS A FINGERPRINT AT LEAST FOR PURPOSES OF
10:09:42  SO WHICH ONE DO I PICK?
10:09:44  I HAVE TWO OPTIONS.
10:09:42  THIS DISCUSSION.
10:09:45  THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT THE SAME.
10:09:47  ONE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER.
10:09:48  RIGHT?
10:09:49  OKAY.
10:09:50  SO A LOT OF PEOPLE INSTINCTIVELY, A LOT OF
10:09:53  CONSUMERS -- WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE ARE
10:09:55  CONSUMER LEVEL DEVICES.
10:09:56  MOST PEOPLE WHO USE SMARTPHONES THESE DAYS ARE
10:10:02  ATECHNICAL.
10:10:03  SO BIOMETRICS LOOKS REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT'S
10:10:07  HOLLYWOOD LEVEL TECHNOLOGY.
10:10:08  RIGHT?
10:10:08  I MEAN, THE LAST GENERATION OF PHONES DIDN'T
10:10:10  HAVE BIOMETRICS.
10:10:12  IT ONE DOES, SO CLEARLY, THIS IS NEW, SHINY,
10:10:15  AND THEREFORE BETTER.
10:10:16  HOWEVER, BIOMETRICS HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS.
10:10:19  I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT MOST OF THEM IN
10:10:21  DETAIL, BUT LIKE ONE OF THEM IS KEY ROTATION.
10:10:23  LIKE IF I DON'T LIKE THIS KEY ANYMORE. IF FOR
10:10:26  SOME REASON I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ATTACKER
10:10:28  SOMEWHERE THAT HAS MY FINGERPRINT, THEN HOW DO
10:10:32  LIKE I CAN'T CUT OFF MY THUMB AND EXPECT A NEW
10:10:35  ONE TO BE THERE TOMORROW WITH A NEW
10:10:30  I SWITCH OUT MY KEY.
10:10:36  FINGERPRINT.
10:10:37  IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
10:10:38  I CAN'T REALLY HAVE SEPARATE CAPABILITIES.
10:10:40  I MEAN, IF I HAVE MY THUMB PRINT, THAT'S MY WAY
10:10:43  OF AUTHENTICATING FOR EVERYTHING.
10:10:46  I GUESS YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 10 OR 20 IF YOU
10:10:48  COUNT YOUR TOES.
10:10:49  IT GETS PUT ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU TOUCH FOR
10:10:51  FREE.
10:10:52  AND IT IS ACTUALLY TOTALLY POSSIBLE TO GET
10:10:54  FINGERPRINTS BACK OFF OF -- EVEN PICTURES,
10:10:57  APPARENTLY, BUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE LIKE
10:10:59  SLIGHTLY GREASY HANDS AND YOU HOLD A GLASS OF
10:11:02  WATER, GUESS WHERE YOUR FINGERPRINT JUST WENT.
10:11:07  IT IS A LITTLE TRICKY.
10:11:08  NOT EVERY RANDOM LOW BROW CRIMINAL CAN
10:11:13  REASONABLY BREAK INTO AN IPHONE WITH A
10:11:15  FINGERPRINT SCANNER.
10:11:16  BUT THAT SAID, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN THE REALM
10:11:19  OF THE IMPOSSIBLE, AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY,
10:11:20  MANY PEOPLE THAT COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS FOR,
10:11:23  LET'S SAY, A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS MAYBE.
10:11:28  TOO.
10:11:29  PEOPLE PICK POOR SECRETS BY AND LARGE.
10:11:26  ON THE OTHER HAND, SECRETS ARE PRETTY TERRIBLE,
10:11:31  AND EVEN IF YOU PICK A REALLY, REALLY GOOD
10:11:33  SECRET, KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'RE USING
10:11:35  SMARTPHONES FOR EVERYTHING, RIGHT?
10:11:37  THAT'S WHAT I STARTED ALL OF THIS WITH.
10:11:40  AND IF YOU'RE OPENING -- IF YOU'RE UNLOCKING
10:11:42  YOUR PHONE, I DON'T KNOW, 20, 30, 40, 50 TIMES
10:11:45  A DAY, THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOMEONE
10:11:47  AROUND THAT FAIRLY REASONABLY COULD SEE WHAT
10:11:51  YOU JUST TYPED INTO THAT THING, AND AS LONG AS
10:11:53  IT'S A SECRET, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD YOUR
10:11:55  CODE IS.
10:11:56  THAT IS MOST OF THE TIME LIKE PEOPLE USE
10:11:58  SOMETHING LIKE 1, 2, 3, 4, OR THE BIRTHDAY OR
10:12:01  ANNIVERSARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
10:12:03  SO OKAY.
10:12:03  USUALLY IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
10:12:05  SO WE'VE REACHED THE FORK.
10:12:08  WHICH ONE DO I PICK.
10:12:09  RIGHT?
10:12:10  I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS.
10:12:12  THEY'RE BOTH NOT PERFECT.
10:12:15  LIKE NEITHER OF THEM -- BOTH OF THEM HAVE
10:12:18  SO HOW DO I KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT FOR ME.
10:12:21  ANY ANSWERS?
10:12:17  FLAWS.
10:12:23  I'VE GOT MODELS OBVIOUSLY OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T
10:12:25  HAVE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS.
10:12:27  AND IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THIS, I'M GOING TO
10:12:29  TALK ABOUT THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.
10:12:31  I'M TALKING ABOUT THE AMERICAN FIFTH AMENDMENT.
10:12:33  I AM FULLY AWARE THAT WE'RE IN CANADA.
10:12:36  THE -- START WITH IT DISCLAIMER.
10:12:39  I'M NOT A LAWYER.
10:12:40  THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.
10:12:41  EVEN IF YOU GIVE ME MONEY, AND I'M NOT SUDDENLY
10:12:44  A LAWYER.
10:12:45  DON'T LISTEN TO ME.
10:12:46  THIS IS ALSO NOT ADVICE, I'M MERELY TRYING TO
10:12:50  ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THREAT MODELS.
10:12:52  SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU THE FIFTH AMENDMENT
10:12:55  SAYS LOTS OF THINGS.
10:12:57  ONE OF THE THINGS IT SAYS IS THAT YOU CANNOT BE
10:13:00  COMPELLED IN ANY CRIMINAL CASE TO BE A WITNESS
10:13:01  FOR YOURSELF.
10:13:02  SORRY FOR THE GRATUITOUS GENERIC LANGUAGE.
10:13:06  I DID NOT WRITE IT.
10:13:07  BASICALLY YOU CANNOT BE FORCED TO DIVULGE
10:13:11  EVEN IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING.
10:13:12  EVEN IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GUILTY IN THE
10:13:10  SECRETS.
10:13:14  OBVIOUS CASE YOU CANNOT BE FORCED TO SAY THAT
10:13:16  YOU'RE GUILTY.
10:13:17  SO BASICALLY, YOU ARE PROTECTED FROM SELF
10:13:20  INCRIMINATION.
10:13:20  IT TURNS OUT, APPARENTLY, I WENT TO THE
10:13:25  PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY OF WIKIPEDIA FOR SOURCES
10:13:28  ON THIS.
10:13:29  THEY CAN'T FORCE SECRETS OUT OF YOU OF ANY
10:13:32  KIND.
10:13:32  PASS CODES ARE SECRETS.
10:13:34  PASSWORDS ARE SECRETS.
10:13:35  THIS IS APPARENTLY HELD UP IN COURT.
10:13:37  HOWEVER, FINGERPRINTS ARE CLEARLY NOT SECRETS.
10:13:40  POLICE CAN AND WILL TAKE YOUR FINGERPRINT.
10:13:42  THEY DO SO BY DEFAULT BASICALLY ALWAYS IF
10:13:45  YOU'RE ARRESTED I THINK IT IS.
10:13:46  SO BY THAT LOGIC, AND THIS ACTUALLY WENT TO
10:13:50  COURT, AND THE JUDGE RULED, NO, YEAH, YOU CAN
10:13:54  TOTALLY BE FORCED TO UNLOCK YOUR PHONE.
10:13:56  THAT IS HOW IT WORKS.
10:13:58  SO SOME PERSON WAS FORCED TO UNLOCK THEIR PHONE
10:14:01  AND SOME SECRETS WERE DIVULGED.
10:14:04  WELL, IT DEPENDS ON YOUR THREAT MODEL.
10:14:07  IF YOUR THREAT MODEL INCLUDES RANDOM PEOPLE,
10:14:03  SO WHICH ONE IS MORE SECURE?
10:14:10  THEN PROBABLY TOUCH ID BECAUSE THE ODDS THAT
10:14:12  YOU EVEN SUBCONSCIOUSLY PICK A REALLY BAD
10:14:16  PASSWORD WITH A PASS CODE IT'S LIKE FOUR
10:14:19  DIGITS.
10:14:20  SHOULDER SURFING IS A REAL THING.
10:14:23  TOUCH ID IS A USEFUL THING AND IT FIXED SOME
10:14:26  STUFF.
10:14:26  IF YOUR THREAT MODEL INCLUDES LAW ENFORCEMENT,
10:14:29  WHICH LET'S BE FAIR, THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF
10:14:32  PEOPLE, THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
10:14:33  ACTIVELY SUPPORT.
10:14:34  I FOR ONE THINK THE AFF IS GREAT.
10:14:37  THEN, YEAH, YOU WANT A PASS CODE BECAUSE PASS
10:14:40  CODES TOTALLY A SECRET.
10:14:42  SO AGAIN, THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.
10:14:46  I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START AN IPHONE.
10:14:49  I'M TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE THREAT MODELS AND THAT
10:14:52  IF YOU DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR
10:14:54  THREAT MODEL YOU CAN TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARGUABLY
10:14:57  IMPROVE YOUR SECURITY BUT DON'T EVEN NOT DO
10:15:01  ANYTHING BUT ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR REAL SECURITY
10:15:03  IN PLACES WHERE IT MATTERS MAKE IT WORSE.
10:15:07  ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE PROTECTING AGAINST,
10:15:09  HOW YOU'RE SECURING IT AND WHAT THE EFFECTS OF
10:15:05  SO THEREFORE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PAY
10:15:11  YOUR ACTIONS THAT YOU CALL SECURING IT ACTUALLY
10:15:14  ARE.
10:15:15  SO LET TO WRAP UP.
10:15:19  LIKE I SAID, THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A MESSAGE OF
10:15:22  HOPE.
10:15:22  RIGHT?
10:15:23  WE CAN DO THIS.
10:15:24  EVEN THOUGH THAT WE HAVE, LOOK, WE HAVE BREAKS
10:15:27  ALL THE TIME, SLACK GOT POPPED, SLACK ARE GREAT
10:15:33  GUYS.
10:15:33  EVERY COMPANY HAS THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS.
10:15:36  EVERY COMPANY IS UNDER ATTACK ALL THE TIME.
10:15:37  IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL YOU ARE.
10:15:40  YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG SEA.
10:15:43  A LOT OF FISH.
10:15:44  SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.
10:15:46  MOST OF OUR SECURITY PRACTICES ARE, QUITE
10:15:48  FRANKLY, BAD.
10:15:49  SO WITH THAT SAID, WE ARE WORKING ON IT.
10:15:52  WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT.
10:15:53  WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING
10:15:55  ON THEM.
10:15:58  GREAT STUFF BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE, FOR
10:16:00  EXAMPLE, THE UB KEYS ARE FANTASTIC.
10:15:56  WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT COMPANIES PRODUCING
10:16:04  IT'S REASONABLE TO HAVE EVERY EMPLOYEE HAVE
10:16:07  SOME TWO FACTOR HARDWARE TOKENS ON THEIR
10:16:10  LANIARDS.
10:16:11  THAT'S FANTASTIC, THAT'S GREAT.
10:16:15  THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE REACH OF A LOT OF
10:16:17  COMPANIES, A LOT OF START-UPS NOT TOO LONG AGO.
10:16:20  AND AS A WHOLE, AS ENGINEERS, WE CAN
10:16:23  MEANINGFULLY IMPACT SECURITY.
10:16:24  LIKE WE WERE DOING IT ALREADY.
10:16:26  AND THE MORE OF YOU THAT JOIN US, THE BETTER.
10:16:28  AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO BE AN EXPERT.
10:16:30  LIKE, OBVIOUSLY, IT HELPS I GUESS.
10:16:32  I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.
10:16:33  BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE
10:16:35  DONE.
10:16:35  THERE'S LOT OF STUFF THAT REALLY DOESN'T
10:16:38  REQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE.
10:16:39  IT'S VERY EASY TO -- WELL, NOT VERY EASY BUT
10:16:43  IT'S POSSIBLE TO TRAIN PEOPLE ON THE JOB.
10:16:46  AND, YEAH, THERE'S LOT THAT YOU CAN DO.
10:16:47  EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.
10:16:50  POSSIBLY SOME OF YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW
10:16:53  YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.
10:16:55  THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A YEAR FROM NOW YOU
10:16:52  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT INFORMATION SECURITY.
10:16:56  CAN'T BE VERY MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE
10:16:59  EVERY DAY OPERATIONAL SECURITY OF LITERALLY
10:17:02  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
10:17:04  AND THAT'S ALL I GOT.
10:17:05  THANKS.
10:17:07  [ APPLAUSE ]
10:17:17  >> I THINK I HAVE JUST UNDER FIVE MINUTES.
10:17:20  IS THAT -- YEAH?
10:17:21  OKAY.
10:17:22  SO I WASN'T GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS, BUT SURE,
10:17:25  GO AHEAD.
10:17:26  YEAH?
10:17:28  >>  OH ON ONE OF YOUR SLIDES THERE WAS
10:17:30  SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING TEAM A TRY TO BREAK WHAT
10:17:34  TEAM B BUILT.
10:17:35  I TOOK THAT TO BE KIND OF A POLICY OF HOW TO
10:17:40  GET SECURITY AS A PRIORITY FOR YOUR COMPANY IN
10:17:43  KIND OF A WAY TO WEAVE IT INTO THE PROCESS.
10:17:46  WAS THAT YOUR INTENT?
10:17:48  AND EITHER WAY, DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW
10:17:50  TO ENCOURAGE YOUR COMPANY IN A SUCCESSFUL WAY
10:17:53  TO FOCUS ON SECURITY BETTER?
10:17:57  YES.
10:17:58  SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT, OBVIOUSLY,
10:17:55  >>  SO THAT WAS AT LEAST PARTIALLY MY INTENT,
10:18:00  ESPECIALLY IF YOU WORK IN A LARGE CORPORATION,
10:18:02  THERE'S FOR MANY PEOPLE VERY LITTLE THEY CAN DO
10:18:05  WITHOUT A CLEAR MANDATE.
10:18:06  LIKE YOU CAN'T JUST DROP WHATEVER IT IS THAT
10:18:09  YOUR JOB IS RIGHT NOW AND SAY, OH, I'M GOING TO
10:18:11  GO FIX SECURITY FOR THE COMPANY.
10:18:14  THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO GET FIRED.
10:18:15  BUT AS FOR HOW TO CONVINCE -- HOW TO CONVINCE
10:18:20  PEOPLE, LIKE IT DEPENDS, RIGHT?
10:18:22  IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON YOUR COMPANY.
10:18:24  THERE'S OBVIOUSLY COMPANIES LIKE PAYMENT
10:18:25  PROCESSORS THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY
10:18:27  SERIOUSLY FROM DAY ONE.
10:18:29  THEN THERE'S COMPANIES WHERE IT'S LIKE THEY SAY
10:18:32  THEY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BUT AT THE END OF THE
10:18:34  DAY OTHER BUSINESS PRIORITIES TAKE OVER.
10:18:36  I THINK HONESTLY OUR BIGGEST ACE THERE IS GOING
10:18:40  TO BE ALL OF THESE PUBLIC BREAKS.
10:18:44  THEY ARE INCREASING IN BOTH SEVERITY AND
10:18:47  FREQUENCY.
10:18:49  MOST IMPORTANTLY, LIKE THEY ARE BECOMING MORE
10:18:51  VISIBLE AND THEREFORE LIKE THERE'S A --
10:18:57  MARGINALLY TECH COMPANIES UNDERSTAND THAT THERE
10:18:59  ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO BREAK
10:18:54  BASICALLY EVERY CEO NOW EVEN FOR ONLY
10:19:01  INTO YOUR SYSTEM AND TO DO BAD THINGS WITH ALL
10:19:04  THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE.
10:19:05  EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
10:19:06  THIS IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
10:19:07  THIS IS GETTING MORE AND MORE TO THE FOREFRONT.
10:19:11  AS TO WHETHER INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES, IF YOU'RE
10:19:13  IN A BIG COMPANY, IT'S REAL HARD TO CONVINCE
10:19:16  ANYONE OF ANYTHING.
10:19:17  THE GOOD NEWS IS OTHER PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING
10:19:19  IT FOR YOU.
10:19:20  >>  THANK YOU.
10:19:23  >>  DONE-DONE?
10:19:25  YEAH.
10:19:26  OKAY.
10:19:26  SORRY.
10:19:26  I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS EITHER OUTSIDE
10:19:29  IN THE HALLWAY OR THERE WILL PROBABLY BE AN
10:19:31  OPEN SPACE THAT'S SECURITY RELATED AT SOME
10:19:33  POINT.
10:19:34  SO THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
10:19:36  [ APPLAUSE ]
