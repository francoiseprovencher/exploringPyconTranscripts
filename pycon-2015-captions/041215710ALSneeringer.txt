01:39:29:01  >> FOR PEOPLE COMING IN, MOON
01:39:31:10  LIMB'S TALK ON REACT.JS IS
01:39:37:01  CANCELED.
01:39:37:13  WE HAVE A REPLACEMENT TALK.
01:39:39:04  LUKE SNEERINGER IS GONNA GIVE A
01:39:41:28  TALK IN THREE MINUTES.
01:43:31:16  >> MOON LIMB'S TALK ON REACT.JS
01:43:43:10  IS CANCELED.
01:43:44:19  LUKE SNEERINGER IS GONNA BE HERE
01:43:47:16  ANY MINUTE.
01:43:48:19  SO JUST HANG ON.
01:44:18:22  >> CHECK, CHECK.
01:44:19:25  HEY, I AM ON.
01:44:21:22  HELLO, EVERYONE.
01:44:22:13  I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT
01:44:24:04  HOW TO IMPROVE DEVELOPMENT
01:44:25:25  ENVIRONMENTS WITH
01:44:26:13  VIRTUALIZATION.
01:44:30:01  AS A MINOR SIDE NOTE, I WILL
01:44:32:10  ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT
01:44:36:07  DOESN'T WORK.
01:44:36:28  I'LL ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW
01:44:38:25  TO IMPROVE SLIDE LAYOUTS WITH
01:44:40:22  SHORTER TITLES, BECAUSE IF IT
01:44:42:10  TAKES THREE LINES, IT REALLY
01:44:44:07  DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD,
01:44:45:13  SOMETHING I LEARNED AS I WAS
01:44:47:10  MAKING THE SLIDES FOR THIS
01:44:49:10  PRESENTATION.
01:44:49:19  AS A QUICK NOTE, I AM NOT THE
01:44:52:16  SPEAKER ON THE SCHEDULE.
01:44:55:10  I AM NOT MOON LIMB.
01:45:01:13  THOSE RESPONSIBLE HAVE BEEN
01:45:03:16  SACKED AND A NEW TALK HAS BEEN
01:45:06:19  PUT TOGETHER.
01:45:07:13  WHO I ACTUALLY AM, I AM A
01:45:11:13  SOFTWARE DEVELOPER AT ANSIBLE.
01:45:13:07  WE DO SERVER ORCHESTRATION.
01:45:15:07  YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF US.
01:45:16:25  THERE WAS A TALK ON ANSIBLE
01:45:18:22  YESTERDAY.
01:45:19:13  I'M MARRIED TO MEGAN, WHO IS
01:45:21:07  SITTING IN THE SECOND ROW AND IS
01:45:22:25  ALSO THE BEST WIFE EVER, AND I
01:45:24:13  LIVE IN TEXAS.
01:45:25:16  THERE WE GO.
01:45:26:07  OKAY, SO I'M GONNA TALK REAL
01:45:28:01  FAST ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE, WHAT
01:45:29:16  IS -- WHERE ARE WE?
01:45:32:07  WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT HOW WE
01:45:34:04  CAN IMPROVE?
01:45:34:19  SO THE LANDSCAPE.
01:45:36:13  SADLY, IT'S NOT THAT ONE.
01:45:39:07  DIFFERENT KIND OF LANDSCAPE.
01:45:42:22  HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE STARTED A
01:45:45:10  NEW TECH JOB IN THE LAST FEW
01:45:47:07  YEARS?
01:45:47:13  ALMOST EVERYBODY.
01:45:49:01  OKAY.
01:45:51:13  SO YOU GO TO YOUR NEW JOB AND
01:45:53:22  WHAT IS YOUR FIRST WEEK LOOK
01:45:55:10  LIKE?
01:45:55:22  IT PROBABLY LOOKS LIKE GETTING
01:45:58:16  YOUR COMPUTER, FILLING OUT YOUR
01:46:01:28  H.R. FORMS AND AT SOME POINT,
01:46:04:04  YOU ARE ASSIGNED TO WORK ON A
01:46:06:07  PROJECT.
01:46:06:16  AND YOU GO TO YOUR COWORKERS,
01:46:11:28  PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY THERE,
01:46:13:01  AND YOU SAY, I NEED TO SET UP A
01:46:15:10  DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS
01:46:16:28  NEW PROJECT.
01:46:17:25  AND WHAT YOU OFTEN GET KIND OF
01:46:20:10  LOOKS LIKE THE HOMESTAR RUNNER
01:46:23:04  VERSION OF TECHNOLOGY.
01:46:25:19  LIKE, "YOU WILL NEED A FEW DAYS
01:46:28:16  TO GET YOUR DEVELOPMENT
01:46:30:19  ENVIRONMENT UP."
01:46:31:22  OR... "OH, DOCUMENTATION?
01:46:34:04  WE NEED THAT?"
01:46:35:10  IT'S JUST BAD.
01:46:37:28  IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH TIME CAN
01:46:41:04  BE WASTED AS YOU TRY TO JUST GET
01:46:45:28  GOING.
01:46:46:25  AND THEN YOU GO AND LOOK AT YOUR
01:46:51:13  GITHUB TICKETS, AND SOMEONE
01:46:53:13  SAYS, IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE.
01:46:56:19  AND IT JUST -- NONE OF THESE
01:46:58:10  THINGS REALLY WANT TO MAKE YOU
01:47:00:16  BLAST OFF FIREWORKS AND SING THE
01:47:02:22  HALLELUJAH CHORUS AND BE LIKE,
01:47:05:28  YEAH, THIS IS AWESOME!
01:47:07:28  THAT'S NOT HOW THINGS SHOULD BE.
01:47:10:04  AND SO WE SHOULD FIX IT.
01:47:12:28  WE SHOULD MAKE IT BETTER.
01:47:14:10  AND WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING
01:47:17:07  DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS,
01:47:18:07  THERE'S A FEW -- THERE'S A FEW
01:47:20:19  STANDARDS THINGS THAT IT SEEMS
01:47:22:07  LIKE WE OUGHT TO HAVE FOR THINGS
01:47:24:01  TO BE WORKING WELL.
01:47:25:07  WE SHOULD BE HAVING DEVELOPMENT
01:47:26:25  ENVIRONMENTS THAT MIRROR
01:47:28:07  PRODUCTION AS MUCH AS IS
01:47:29:19  REASONABLY POSSIBLE.
01:47:30:28  IT SHOULD BE THAT OUR
01:47:33:04  DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS LOOK
01:47:34:16  AND RUN A WHOLE LOT LIKE OUR
01:47:38:19  SERVERS, OUR PRODUCTION
01:47:40:01  MACHINES.
01:47:41:16  IF WE'RE MAKING A DESKTOP
01:47:43:10  APPLICATION OR A SCRIPT OR AN
01:47:45:07  EXECUTABLE OR WHATEVER, THERE
01:47:46:16  SHOULDN'T BE ANY FACTORS THAT
01:47:48:28  MAKE THE DEVELOPMENT RUN
01:47:50:04  DIFFERENTLY, EXCEPT FOR THINGS
01:47:51:10  THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY
01:47:52:16  DEVELOPER-SPECIFIC, AND WE'LL
01:47:54:01  GET BACK TO THAT.
01:47:55:10  IT SHOULD BE LOW COST.
01:47:56:19  IF YOU DO SOMETHING TO SCREW UP
01:47:58:13  YOUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT,
01:47:59:25  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST BLOW
01:48:01:13  IT AWAY AND MAKE A NEW ONE.
01:48:03:07  AND THE LAST THING, HAS ANYONE
01:48:06:01  EVER TRIED TO DEVELOP ON
01:48:07:19  MACHINES THAT ARE EXACTLY LIKE
01:48:10:16  YOUR PRODUCTION MACHINES?
01:48:12:25  YOU CAN GO MAKE A CLOUD SERVER
01:48:14:28  THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE YOUR
01:48:16:25  PRODUCTION MACHINE, CAN BE IN
01:48:17:28  THE SAME PLACE, YOU KNOW, NYC2
01:48:22:16  OR WHATEVER, WHATEVER LOCATION
01:48:23:22  ON THE SAME PROVIDER, IT CAN
01:48:26:04  LOOK EXACTLY LIKE IT, BUT YOU
01:48:28:10  KNOW WHAT?
01:48:30:25  IT REALLY, REALLY, REALLY STARTS
01:48:32:13  TO SUCK TO DEVELOP THAT WAY.
01:48:34:16  I'M GOING TO SSHN, AND THEN I'M
01:48:37:19  GOING TO DO ALL OF MY DEVELOP IN
01:48:40:07  VIM AND KEEP EVERYTHING TOGETHER
01:48:43:16  IN LS, AND IT'S JUST NOT REALLY
01:48:45:25  VERY FUN.
01:48:46:13  AND OF COURSE EVERY SINGLE TIME
01:48:48:01  YOU MAKE A CHANGE, YOU HAVE TO
01:48:52:04  RIGHT QUIT OUT OF VIM, OR
01:48:55:04  WHATEVER SERVER YOU HAPPEN TO BE
01:48:56:16  USING, IF IT'S A SCRIPT, THEN
01:48:59:04  IT'S A MATTER OF RUNNING IN THE
01:49:01:01  ENVIRONMENT AND RESETTING YOUR
01:49:02:25  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.
01:49:03:25  AND WHEN DO WE WANT IT?
01:49:05:07  NOW.
01:49:06:04  WHY?
01:49:06:22  BECAUSE THAT'S THE MEME.
01:49:10:07  WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF DOING
01:49:11:16  THIS?
01:49:12:10  AND AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
01:49:13:19  QUESTION, I REALLY CAME UP WITH
01:49:15:04  THREE THINGS:  PORTABILITY,
01:49:17:22  CONSISTENCY, AND REUSABILITY.
01:49:19:25  I'M GONNA TALK VERY BRIEFLY
01:49:21:25  ABOUT EACH ONE.
01:49:22:13  PORTABILITY, THAT'S THAT NEW
01:49:23:28  HIRE SITUATION.
01:49:28:01  YOU COME AS A NEW HIRE TO A NEW
01:49:30:25  COMPANY -- WOULD BE NICE IF YOU
01:49:33:01  COULD JUST HAVE A SETUP, AND IT
01:49:35:07  WOULD JUST WORK.
01:49:36:04  AND PORTABILITY IS WHAT GIVES
01:49:38:22  YOU THAT.
01:49:39:07  IT'S, YES, WE ALREADY WROTE THIS
01:49:41:28  CODE TO SET UP A DEVELOPMENT
01:49:44:07  ENVIRONMENT, AND ALL YOU HAVE TO
01:49:45:19  DO IS INSTALL THIS PROGRAM AND
01:49:49:07  RUN THIS.
01:49:50:07  AND RUN THIS THING.
01:49:51:07  AND YOU, TOO, CAN START ACTUALLY
01:49:53:22  WORKING.
01:49:54:07  CONSISTENCY, WE'VE ALREADY
01:49:56:22  TALKED ABOUT.
01:49:58:01  CONSISTENCY IS, THERE SHOULDN'T
01:49:59:28  BE DIFFERENCES THAT MAKE IT SO
01:50:01:13  THAT IT WORKS WHEN I'M WRITING
01:50:04:25  IN DEVELOPMENT AND BREAKS WHEN
01:50:08:07  IT'S RUNNING ON PRODUCTION
01:50:11:10  MACHINES, WHEN IT'S THE THING
01:50:12:25  THAT THE CUSTOMER'S USING.
01:50:14:19  AND REUSABILITY IS, I SHOULD BE
01:50:18:22  ABLE TO DO THIS OFTEN.
01:50:20:01  I SHOULD BE ABLE TO BLOW UP A
01:50:21:16  BOX AND MAKE A NEW ONE.
01:50:24:01  I SHOULD BE ABLE GET INTO A
01:50:25:28  PRISTINE STATE BECAUSE WHEN
01:50:27:28  YOU'RE HACKING ON THINGS, YOU
01:50:29:16  GET OUT OF A PRISTINE STATE.
01:50:31:07  YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS
01:50:32:25  DIFFERENTLY TO SEE WHAT WORKS.
01:50:34:28  REUSABILITY LETS YOU PULL BACK
01:50:37:10  INTO A PRISTINE STATE.
01:50:40:04  AND THIS CONCEPT IS REALLY
01:50:41:19  USEABLE EVERYWHERE.
01:50:42:25  IT'S USEABLE -- MOST OF MY
01:50:44:25  EXAMPLES ARE ON SERVER SIDE
01:50:46:10  APPLICATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S
01:50:47:10  WHERE I'M THE MOST FAMILIAR,
01:50:49:01  BUT, REALLY, THIS ISN'T A
01:50:50:07  CONCEPT THAT'S RESTRICTED TO
01:50:51:16  THAT.
01:50:52:01  A DESKTOP APPLICATION CAN RUN
01:50:54:01  OFF THIS TYPE OF APPLICATION.
01:50:55:25  THERE ISN'T REALLY A CASE WHERE
01:50:57:22  A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T
01:50:59:07  MAKE SENSE.
01:50:59:22  AND SO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW
01:51:02:04  TO USE THEM.
01:51:02:25  SO A QUICK BIT ON TOOLS.
01:51:07:22  THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF TOOLS TO
01:51:09:10  DO THIS KIND OF THING, AND WHAT
01:51:12:28  EXAMPLE COULD I HAVE, I PICKED A
01:51:15:13  COUPLE TO EXPLAIN.
01:51:16:28  BUT I AM NOT TRYING TO PUSH THAT
01:51:18:28  THIS IS THE ONLY TOOLS TO USE.
01:51:20:28  I'M TRYING TO PUSH THE CONCEPT.
01:51:22:28  WHICH IS WHY WE'RE AT 10 MINUTES
01:51:25:22  INTO THE TALK AND I REALLY ONLY
01:51:27:28  TALKED ABOUT CONCEPTUAL --
01:51:29:22  TRYING TO SELL THE CONCEPT TO
01:51:31:04  YOU.
01:51:32:04  PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR TOOL
01:51:33:10  FOR ACTUALLY DOING
01:51:34:25  VIRTUALIZATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
01:51:36:19  WORK SPECIFICALLY IS A TOOL
01:51:37:28  CALLED VAGRANT.
01:51:39:13  VAGRANT IS A WRAPPER AROUND
01:51:42:13  OTHER TOOLS, MOST NOTABLY
01:51:44:19  VIRTUALBOX AND VMWARE.
01:51:47:10  THERE'S A COUPLE OF COMPETITORS.
01:51:49:01  THERE'S ONE CALLED BOX CLIFF AND
01:51:51:01  ANOTHER CALLED VORTEX.
01:51:52:19  I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE FORMER
01:51:54:25  OF THOSE WHEN I WROTE THESE
01:51:56:10  SLIDES, SO I ENDED UP WITH A
01:51:59:04  SLIDE WHERE EVERY SINGLE THING
01:52:00:28  JUST STARTS WITH A V, WELL,
01:52:03:04  WHICH, FINE.
01:52:04:01  IT'S CONVENIENT.
01:52:04:19  I FIGURED I WOULD GET AT LEAST A
01:52:08:10  GOOD LAUGH FOR THAT.
01:52:09:13  THANK YOU IN THE BACK.
01:52:10:28  THERE'S A LOT MORE PROVISIONING
01:52:14:07  TOOLS AVAILABLE.
01:52:15:01  SO THERE WERE SEVERAL TALKS
01:52:17:28  YESTERDAY ON VARIOUS DIFFERENT
01:52:21:04  PROVISIONING TOOLS.
01:52:22:01  JAMES GAVE A TALK ON ANSIBLE.
01:52:24:25  NOAH LAST YEAR GAVE A TALK ON
01:52:27:16  CHEF.
01:52:27:28  THERE WAS A TALK THIS YEAR ON
01:52:30:04  DOCKER.
01:52:30:28  THERE WAS A TALK LAST YEAR ON
01:52:32:22  SALTSTACK.
01:52:33:16  THE PURPOSE OF A PROVISIONING IS
01:52:35:10  TO GET THINGS INTO A PARTICULAR
01:52:37:07  STATE.
01:52:37:16  I'M GONNA COME BACK TO THIS IN
01:52:39:13  JUST A MOMENT BUT JUST SAY THERE
01:52:41:25  ARE SEVERAL TOOLS TO USE.
01:52:44:07  YOU ARE HOPEFULLY ALREADY USING
01:52:46:13  THIS CONCEPT IN YOUR PRODUCTION
01:52:48:13  ENVIRONMENTS FOR ACTUALLY GIVING
01:52:50:01  YOUR CODE TO THE ULTIMATE
01:52:51:16  CLIENT, TO THE ULTIMATE
01:52:52:28  CUSTOMER.
01:52:53:10  AND SO, REALLY, IT SHOULD JUST
01:52:55:28  BE A MATTER OF TAKING THIS AND
01:52:58:25  MAKING IT USEFUL FOR DEVELOPMENT
01:53:00:19  AS WELL.
01:53:01:01  I'M OPERATING UNDER THE
01:53:02:28  ASSUMPTION THAT MANY, IF NOT
01:53:05:28  MOST OF YOU, HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN
01:53:07:28  INTO THE WORLD OF PROVISIONING
01:53:09:01  FOR PRODUCTION USE.
01:53:11:28  IF YOU HAVEN'T, I HIGHLY
01:53:14:01  RECOMMEND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE
01:53:15:28  TALKS THAT WERE GIVEN YESTERDAY
01:53:18:04  AND LAST YEAR ON THIS TOPIC,
01:53:19:13  BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO
01:53:21:19  ANYTHING OTHER THAN BARELY
01:53:23:07  SCRATCH THE SURFACE.
01:53:24:25  AND BY THE WAY, THE ONLY REASON
01:53:27:04  THE KING OF TOWN IS ON THIS
01:53:29:10  SLIDE IS BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I
01:53:31:10  NEEDED A PICTURE.
01:53:32:16  SO AGAIN, TRYING TO PITCH
01:53:33:28  PROVISIONING, THE PURPOSE OF
01:53:35:13  PROVISIONING IS TO GET A MACHINE
01:53:36:28  INTO A DEFINED STATE.
01:53:38:07  IT SAYS I DON'T REALLY CARE
01:53:40:04  ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER ASPECTS OF
01:53:42:13  A MACHINE; HOWEVER, THESE THINGS
01:53:43:28  ARE THE THINGS THAT A MACHINE
01:53:45:16  MUST HAVE.
01:53:46:01  THIS IS THE STATE IT MUST BE IN.
01:53:47:25  HOW DO WE DEFINE THE STATE IN
01:53:49:19  PRESENCE OF THE CODE TO RUN?
01:53:51:04  PRESENCE OF OBJECTS INSTALLED?
01:53:53:19  CERTAIN CONFIGURATION BEING SET,
01:53:55:28  ALL THOSE THINGS.
01:53:58:01  IT SHOULD MOSTLY MATCH HOW YOU
01:53:59:25  DEFINE STATE IN PRODUCTION.
01:54:01:01  AND THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO GET A
01:54:03:19  LOT OF VALUE OUT OF WHAT I AM
01:54:05:04  TALKING ABOUT TODAY, PROBABLY
01:54:06:13  YOU ALREADY NEED TO HAVE
01:54:07:19  PRODUCTION PROVISIONING DONE.
01:54:09:04  IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO
01:54:11:16  HAVE DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONING IF
01:54:13:04  YOU DON'T HAVE PRODUCTION
01:54:14:22  PROVISIONING, EXCEPT FOR THE
01:54:16:16  FACT THAT IF YOU ARE JUST TRYING
01:54:18:13  TO GET INTO THIS WORLD, USING
01:54:20:19  DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONING CAN BE
01:54:22:16  A VERY LOW RISK, LOW COST WAY TO
01:54:26:19  GET YOUR FEET WET, AND THEN
01:54:28:22  AFTER THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED
01:54:30:16  AND WORKING, THEN IT CAN BE
01:54:32:01  PORTED TO PRODUCTION.
01:54:33:01  THAT IS A VALID AND SENSIBLE WAY
01:54:36:13  TO GO.
01:54:37:01  SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO JUST RUN A
01:54:42:10  GENERIC SERVER SIDE APPLICATION?
01:54:44:13  WELL, YOU PROBABLY NEED THREE
01:54:45:25  BASIC THINGS.
01:54:46:22  YOU NEED TO INSTALL SOFTWARE
01:54:50:01  THAT'S NOT PYTHON BASED.
01:54:52:16  YOUR WEB SERVER, IF YOU'RE A WEB
01:54:54:22  PERSON, YOUR, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER
01:54:56:13  ELSE.
01:54:57:25  YOUR FIREWALL, YOUR BLAH, BLAH,
01:55:00:22  BLAH.
01:55:01:04  YOU PROBABLY NEED TO INSTALL
01:55:02:19  PYTHON PACKAGES BECAUSE ONE OF
01:55:03:28  THE REASONS WHY YOU USE PYTHON
01:55:06:10  IS NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL.
01:55:10:13  AND THEN CONFIGURING ALL OF THE
01:55:12:16  ABOVE IS THE LAST THING YOU NEED
01:55:14:01  TO DO.
01:55:14:25  PRETTY MUCH NO MATTER WHAT YOUR
01:55:16:16  APPLICATION LOOKS LIKE, YOU
01:55:17:28  PROBABLY ARE DOING ALL OF THESE
01:55:19:04  THINGS.
01:55:19:19  EVEN IF YOU'RE CREATING A
01:55:21:16  DESKTOP APPLICATION OR A SCRIPT,
01:55:23:28  YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING ALL OF
01:55:25:07  THESE THINGS.
01:55:25:28  AS FAR AS VIRTUALIZATION IS
01:55:31:19  CONCERNED, IT'S REALLY, REALLY,
01:55:34:25  REALLY, EASY TO MAKE A CLOUD
01:55:36:25  SERVER AND PROVISION IT.
01:55:37:28  THERE'S A BUNCH OF THEM.
01:55:39:25  THAT WILL LET YOU DO SOMETHING
01:55:42:13  LIKE THAT.
01:55:43:01  I'LL PAY $5 A MONTH FOR IT AND
01:55:45:04  LOOK, I HAVE ROOT ON A VERY TINY
01:55:47:16  BOX.
01:55:48:01  AND I CAN DO ALL MY DEVELOPMENT
01:55:50:07  ON THAT.
01:55:50:25  BUT IT'S REALLY PAINFUL TO
01:55:52:07  ACTUALLY DO WORK ON THOSE
01:55:53:13  THINGS.
01:55:53:28  IT CAN BE DONE.
01:55:55:01  YOU CAN USE NFS TO SYNC FOLDERS
01:55:59:22  AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
01:56:02:04  IT CAN BE DONE.
01:56:03:01  BUT IT'S NOT FUN.
01:56:04:10  IT'S PRETTY PAINFUL.
01:56:06:13  AND THE PROBLEM IS, WORKING IN
01:56:08:07  PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS IS
01:56:09:10  PAINFUL.
01:56:10:01  AND IT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE
01:56:12:16  BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE
01:56:13:22  HACKING IN PRODUCTION.
01:56:15:10  BUT IF WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE
01:56:18:10  THESE PRODUCTION CONCEPTS AND
01:56:19:25  PORT THEM TO A DEVELOPMENT
01:56:21:16  ENVIRONMENT, USING ENVIRONMENT
01:56:24:19  KIND OF IN A DOUBLE WAY THERE,
01:56:27:22  THEN WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT
01:56:30:01  PAIN.
01:56:31:04  AND IN REALITY, AS MUCH AS I
01:56:33:01  SAID THAT DEVELOPMENT SHOULD
01:56:34:10  MIRROR PRODUCTION AS MUCH AS
01:56:35:19  POSSIBLE, THERE MUST BE SOME
01:56:37:01  DIFFERENCES.
01:56:37:19  REALLY, AT LEAST THREE.
01:56:41:01  ONE, YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO CODE
01:56:43:16  LOCALLY.
01:56:46:13  BECAUSE UNLESS YOU ARE VERY,
01:56:47:19  VERY LOOSE ABOUT WHAT YOUR
01:56:49:25  PERSONAL, YOU KNOW, PREFERENCE
01:56:54:01  ENVIRONMENT LOOKS LIKE, YOU
01:56:56:01  PROBABLY ARE VERY PICKY ABOUT
01:56:57:25  HAVING YOUR MACROS SET UP IN A
01:57:00:04  PARTICULAR WAY.
01:57:01:07  AND SO YOU NEED TO WORK LOCALLY.
01:57:02:28  YOU NEED YOUR DEVELOPMENT
01:57:04:01  ENVIRONMENT TO KNOW THAT IT'S A
01:57:05:13  DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT.
01:57:06:04  AN ERROR THAT GIVES YOU LOTS OF
01:57:08:28  INFORMATION INCLUDING YOUR
01:57:10:01  DATABASE CREDENTIALS AND WHATNOT
01:57:13:07  IS REALLY BAD FOR A PRODUCTION
01:57:15:25  SYSTEM, BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR
01:57:17:07  A DEVELOPMENT ONE.
01:57:18:13  HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION GO TO
01:57:19:13  THE LOGS OR TO SOMEBODY'S EMAIL.
01:57:21:19  IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN YOUR
01:57:23:19  DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM, YOU WANT IT
01:57:25:01  IN YOUR FACE WITH AS MUCH
01:57:26:22  INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE SO YOU
01:57:28:01  CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS QUICKLY
01:57:30:01  AS POSSIBLE.
01:57:30:19  AND THE LAST THING IS
01:57:31:19  RESPONSIVENESS OF TOOLS TO
01:57:32:28  CHANGES.
01:57:33:13  WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SAVE A NEW
01:57:34:19  FILE, YOU WANT YOUR SERVERS TO
01:57:36:22  RELOAD AND GET THOSE CHANGES.
01:57:38:13  AND THERE'S A FEW OTHER NICE
01:57:41:10  THINGS THAT ARE GOOD TO HAVE.
01:57:42:22  FLEXIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTS.
01:57:44:07  IF YOU'RE WORKING ON A TOOL THAT
01:57:46:01  RUNS IN MULTIPLE STATES, SAY, AN
01:57:48:07  EXECUTABLE THAT NEEDS TO RUN IN
01:57:50:04  MULTIPLE DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTIONS
01:57:53:19  OF LINUX, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
01:57:55:22  SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT YOUR
01:57:56:25  VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS TO BE ABLE
01:57:58:10  COVER.
01:57:58:22  YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A
01:58:00:19  VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN EVERY
01:58:01:25  NECESSARY DISTRIBUTION.
01:58:02:28  AND THE ABILITY TO SHARE.
01:58:04:16  SO I SHOULD SHOW YOU SOME CODE.
01:58:07:01  SO FIRST OF ALL, THE TOOLS THAT
01:58:10:16  I'M CHOOSING TO DISCUSS ARE
01:58:13:04  VAGRANT AND VIRTUALBOX.
01:58:15:25  THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY TOOLS.
01:58:17:16  VAGRANT PROJECTS USES A VAGRANT
01:58:20:10  FILE.
01:58:20:22  THIS IS SPECIFIC TO DEVELOPMENT.
01:58:21:19  IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MIRROR
01:58:23:16  AGAINST PRODUCTION, WHICH IS
01:58:24:16  VERY USEFUL, AND IF YOU'RE SMART
01:58:26:19  ABOUT THE WAY YOU WRITE YOUR
01:58:29:07  VAGRANT FILE, THERE'S NO REASON
01:58:31:01  WHY YOU CAN'T COMMIT IT TO
01:58:32:25  VERSION CONTROL.
01:58:33:13  IT DEFINES ONE OR MORE MACHINES,
01:58:35:19  AND IT DEFINES A PROVISIONER.
01:58:37:10  A MACHINE IS BASICALLY A VIRTUAL
01:58:39:19  MACHINE THAT IT SHOULD CREATE,
01:58:40:28  AND THE PROVISIONER IS A TOOL,
01:58:42:19  THE THIRD-PARTY PROVISIONER THAT
01:58:44:10  YOU'RE GOING TO USE AT YOUR SHOP
01:58:46:04  SUCH AS ANSIBLE OR CHEF OR
01:58:48:22  FABRIC OR WHATEVER ELSE.
01:58:51:19  SO LET'S LOOK AT WHAT DEFINING A
01:58:54:07  MACHINE LOOKS LIKE.
01:58:55:16  I'M NOT GONNA KEEP THIS CODE UP
01:58:57:10  ON THE SLIDES FOR A SUPER LONG
01:58:59:25  TIME.
01:59:00:10  MOSTLY THIS IS A CONCEPTUAL
01:59:02:04  TALK.
01:59:02:16  YOU CAN LOOK AT VAGRANT.COM TO
01:59:04:19  GET THE -- WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT
01:59:07:04  OPERATING SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO
01:59:08:19  RUN.
01:59:08:28  WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IP ADDRESS
01:59:12:01  IT'S GONNA HAVE WITHIN OUR LOCAL
01:59:13:19  ENVIRONMENT WORLD AND THEN HOW
01:59:14:25  MUCH MEMORY IT'S GOING TO HAVE.
01:59:16:10  PROVISIONING LOOKS SIMILAR.
01:59:19:01  I'M GONNA SPEND A LITTLE BIT
01:59:20:10  LONGER HERE.
01:59:21:07  SO YOU SAY WHAT PROVISIONER YOU
01:59:22:22  NEED TO USE WITH THIS FUNKY RUBY
01:59:24:28  DSL.
01:59:26:01  AND ONE OF THE NICE THINGS YOU
01:59:27:16  CAN DO IS, YOU CAN DO THINGS
01:59:29:04  LIKE DEFINE A COUPLE OF EXTRA
01:59:30:25  VARIABLES.
01:59:31:13  AND THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU
01:59:32:22  CAN START TO TELL YOUR SYSTEM
01:59:34:04  THAT THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT BOX.
01:59:36:07  IT SHOULDN'T ACT QUITE LIKE A
01:59:38:01  PRODUCTION BOX.
01:59:39:04  NOTICE I HAVE AS PART OF MY
01:59:41:01  ANSIBLE EXTRA BARS DEVELOPMENT
01:59:42:25  EQUALS TRUE.
01:59:43:25  WELL, NOW, WHENEVER I'M RUNNING
01:59:46:07  MY ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS, WHICH
01:59:48:28  OBVIOUSLY ARE ABLE TO CREATE A
01:59:50:13  PRODUCTION SYSTEM, ONE OF THE
01:59:51:01  THINGS THEY CAN DO IS, IN ANY
01:59:52:25  TEMPLATE, THEY CAN SAY, WELL, IF
01:59:54:25  DEVELOPMENT, DO THIS SLIGHTLY
01:59:56:13  DIFFERENT THING.
01:59:56:28  I WANT ALL MY PRODUCTION STUFF.
01:59:58:16  I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE WORKING
02:00:00:01  THE SAME WAY IT'S WORKING IN
02:00:01:13  PRODUCTION EXCEPT THIS ONE SPOT.
02:00:03:10  THIS ONE SPOT SHOULD BE
02:00:05:10  DIFFERENT BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T
02:00:06:13  WANT TO SHOOT MYSELF IN THE HEAD
02:00:08:07  OVER THE PAIN.
02:00:09:10  WELL, WHERE DO WE STAND AT THIS
02:00:11:25  POINT?
02:00:12:25  WELL, NOW YOU CAN VAGRANT UP AND
02:00:14:25  PROVISION A PRODUCTION MACHINE.
02:00:16:01  AND THEN YOU'RE SAD.
02:00:19:16  SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO
02:00:21:16  DIFFERENTIATION.
02:00:22:10  MOST LIKELY YOU PROBABLY DON'T
02:00:23:28  WANT TO BE SHELLING TO YOUR
02:00:26:16  VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT TO DO YOUR
02:00:28:07  WORK.
02:00:28:25  BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF PAIN
02:00:30:01  THAT YOU WANT TO GET AWAY FROM.
02:00:32:04  VAGRANT PROVIDES A WAY TO
02:00:34:28  SYNCHRONIZE A FOLDER BETWEEN THE
02:00:37:07  HOST MACHINE, YOUR DESKTOP THAT
02:00:39:22  YOU'RE SITTING AT, AND YOUR
02:00:41:25  GUEST MACHINE, WHICH IS
02:00:43:01  VM.SYNCED FOLDER.
02:00:47:07  SO THIS IS ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN
02:00:48:19  NOW HAVE A LOCAL CODE ON YOUR
02:00:50:13  VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS.
02:00:52:04  YOU USE WHATEVER EDITOR, IEE
02:00:56:13  TYPE OF THING THAT YOU WANT TO
02:00:57:19  USE, AND AS SOON AS YOU MAKE A
02:00:59:10  SAVE, THAT SAVE IS REFLECTED ON
02:01:01:07  THE VIRTUAL MACHINE.
02:01:03:13  FOR DEVELOPMENT AWARENESS, THE
02:01:05:28  EASIEST WAY I FOUND IS PROVIDE A
02:01:08:04  DEVELOPMENT FLAG TO YOUR
02:01:09:10  PROVISIONER, AND THEN IT'S
02:01:10:13  REALLY EASY IN YOUR PROVISIONER
02:01:12:01  TOOL, WHEN YOU'RE CONFIGURING
02:01:14:13  YOUR TOOLS SAY I NEED TO
02:01:16:07  CONFIGURE THIS TOOL TO BE IN A
02:01:17:25  DEVELOPMENT STATE.
02:01:18:13  THE EXAMPLE I USED IS JUST
02:01:20:10  SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT OF A
02:01:21:25  DJANGO SETTINGS FILE.
02:01:23:25  IF I'M IN DEVELOPMENT, THEN I
02:01:25:25  WANT TO SET DEBUG TO TRUE.
02:01:27:25  RESPONSIVENESS TO CHANGE RUNS ON
02:01:29:10  THE SAME PRINCIPLE.
02:01:30:13  IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE TYPE TOOL,
02:01:31:25  MOST OF THEM HAVE MECHANISMS TO
02:01:33:13  RELOAD THEMSELVES IF SOMETHING
02:01:34:28  CHANGES.
02:01:35:16  YOU JUST HAVE TO TURN THAT
02:01:37:01  CONFIGURATION ON.
02:01:38:07  ALL THAT IS REQUIRED FOR TURNING
02:01:39:22  THAT CONFIGURATION ON IS
02:01:42:13  CONFIGURING IT SLIGHTLY
02:01:43:19  DIFFERENTLY IF YOU'RE ON YOUR
02:01:45:25  DEVELOPMENT MACHINE RATHER THAN
02:01:47:07  YOUR PRODUCTION MACHINE AND MAKE
02:01:49:01  IT RESPOND TO THAT DEVELOPMENT
02:01:50:13  STATE.
02:01:50:22  AND THERE'S SEVERAL ADVANTAGES
02:01:53:13  TO THINKING THROUGH IT THIS WAY.
02:01:55:10  AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE A SYSTEM THAT
02:01:56:25  RUNS IN LOTS OF ENVIRONMENTS,
02:01:58:25  VIRTUALIZATION IS GREAT FOR
02:02:00:04  THAT.
02:02:00:13  IF YOU WANT TO TEST HOW YOUR
02:02:02:10  SYSTEM WILL RUN IN A LOW MEMORY
02:02:04:22  ENVIRONMENT, VIRTUALIZATION IS
02:02:06:04  FANTASTIC FOR THAT.
02:02:07:16  IF YOU ARE TRYING TO TEST AND
02:02:10:25  FIGURE OUT WHAT CHANGES ARE
02:02:13:01  GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS
02:02:16:07  FROM THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO
02:02:17:10  YOUR PROGRAM, VIRTUALIZATION IS
02:02:18:28  GREAT FOR THAT.
02:02:19:16  AND IT'S A VERY LOW RISK, LOW
02:02:22:13  COMMITMENT WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE
02:02:24:10  AT ANY POINT, YOU CAN JUST
02:02:26:07  DESTROY WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND
02:02:27:07  START OVER.
02:02:27:25  AND ANOTHER ADVANTAGE IS IF
02:02:31:16  YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND SOME
02:02:33:19  MONEY, VAGRANT MAKES IT VERY
02:02:35:16  EASY TO SHARE YOUR BOX WITH
02:02:38:04  OTHER PEOPLE.
02:02:38:22  SO I'M GONNA COME BACK TO A
02:02:43:28  PHILOSOPHICAL POINT THAT I'VE
02:02:45:22  BEEN DRIVING REPEATEDLY, WHICH
02:02:48:01  IS DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BEHAVE
02:02:51:04  EXACTLY LIKE PRODUCTION.
02:02:52:22  THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENCES
02:02:55:07  BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND
02:02:56:01  PRODUCTION WHEN POSSIBLE.
02:02:56:25  EXCEPT WHEN IT'S TOO PAINFUL.
02:02:59:22  AT WHICH POINT IT SHOULD BE
02:03:02:22  DIFFERENT, BUT ONLY THERE.
02:03:03:25  AND THE REASON WHY YOU ONLY WANT
02:03:05:10  IT TO BE DIFFERENT THERE IS
02:03:07:04  BECAUSE ANY DIFFERENCE IS A
02:03:10:07  POSSIBILITY FOR AN INCONSISTENCY
02:03:13:25  IN YOUR WORK.
02:03:14:25  HOWEVER, SOMETIMES IT REALLY IS
02:03:16:22  TOO PAINFUL AND IT SHOULD BE
02:03:18:10  DIFFERENT.
02:03:20:07  AND SINCE THIS IS PUT TOGETHER
02:03:22:19  AT GREAT EXPENSE AND AT THE LAST
02:03:24:25  MINUTE, THAT'S ALL I HAVE, BUT I
02:03:26:10  WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS
02:03:27:28  FOR A FEW MINUTES.
02:03:30:13  I WILL NOTE THAT MORE LUKE
02:03:32:19  EQUALS LESS GUIDO, AND THEN I
02:03:36:16  WILL TRY TO LET YOU ALL OUT
02:03:38:22  EARLY.
02:03:39:19  [ Applause ]
02:03:48:19  >> IF YOU HAVE A QUESTIONS,
02:03:50:07  PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE.
02:03:52:25  AS ALWAYS, YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE
02:03:57:10  IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION.
02:03:58:28  >> SO COULD YOU GIVE ME AN
02:04:00:25  EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S TOO PAINFUL?
02:04:02:25  >> SO THE QUESTION FOR THE VIDEO
02:04:05:25  IS, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S
02:04:08:04  TOO PAINFUL.
02:04:08:28  MY BIGGEST PAIN POINT IN THAT
02:04:10:22  KIND OF SITUATION IS THINGS THAT
02:04:12:07  DON'T AUTO RELOAD.
02:04:13:13  IT'S REALLY PAINFUL TO HAVE A
02:04:15:16  SITUATION WHERE I NEED TO SAVE
02:04:18:10  MY FILE, GO RELOAD MY SERVER,
02:04:20:22  RUN THE THING TO CHECK IT, GO
02:04:22:19  MAKE A CHANGE, SAVE THE FILE,
02:04:24:07  RELOAD THE SERVER, RUN THE THING
02:04:26:04  TO CHECK IT.
02:04:26:22  THAT RELOAD THE SERVER STEP
02:04:28:28  SHOULDN'T BE THERE.
02:04:29:28  THAT'S AN UN-OBVIOUS EXAMPLE.
02:04:31:13  ANOTHER ONE IS, I KNOW THAT
02:04:34:16  THERE ARE SOME GURUS, BUT I
02:04:36:13  DON'T DO ALL OF MY DAY-TO-DAY
02:04:40:13  EDITING IN SOMETHING THAT WILL
02:04:42:07  RUN IN A SHELL PRONG.
02:04:45:16  HOWEVER, THAT'S NOT MY PERSONAL
02:04:47:07  PREFERENCE.
02:04:47:16  I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE MY
02:04:49:07  LOCAL DESKTOP TOOLS AGAINST MY
02:04:51:16  VM.
02:04:52:07  YES.
02:04:52:16  >> CAN YOU MAKE A COMMENT ON
02:04:56:10  PERFORMANCE OF VAGRANT VERSUS
02:04:59:22  NATIVE?
02:05:01:13  >> MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT I HAVE
02:05:04:28  NOT DONE ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN
02:05:06:25  INTERESTING ENOUGH TO DO
02:05:08:07  PERFORMANCE TESTING ON.
02:05:09:28  USUALLY THE -- USUALLY WHAT I'M
02:05:12:01  AFTER IS MAKING IT CLOSER TO MY
02:05:15:10  PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.
02:05:16:04  SO MY DESKTOP HAS 32 GIGS OF
02:05:19:10  RAM.
02:05:20:10  WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN ANY
02:05:22:04  OF MY SERVERS.
02:05:23:10  SO -- BUT I'M SURE THAT NATIVE
02:05:25:25  IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
02:05:27:01  BUT I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
02:05:28:16  EXPERIENCE ON HOW MUCH.
02:05:29:16  YES.
02:05:31:07  >> SO I KNOW YOU CAN MAP
02:05:32:22  DIRECTORIES FROM OUTSIDE TO
02:05:34:16  INSIDE THE VM, LIKE YOUR SOURCE
02:05:36:10  DIRECTORY INSIDE THE VAGRANT
02:05:37:22  MACHINE SO YOU CAN WORK ON IT
02:05:39:19  LIVE.
02:05:40:01  WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU NEED TO GO
02:05:41:28  THE OTHER WAY?
02:05:43:28  AND THAT WOULD BE INSIDE THE VM?
02:05:46:22  >> SURE, SO THE QUESTION THAT HE
02:05:48:16  ASKED IS, WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU
02:05:50:04  NEED TO GO THE OTHER DIRECTION?
02:05:51:16  WHAT IF YOU -- WHAT ABOUT THINGS
02:05:53:10  INSIDE THE VM THAT YOU WANT TO
02:05:56:01  PULL OUT?
02:05:56:28  THE ANSWER IS THAT THAT GETS
02:05:59:01  REALLY TRICKY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU
02:06:00:10  HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN THE OS, BUT
02:06:02:13  INSIDE VERSUS OUTSIDE THE VM.
02:06:05:01  YOU CAN'T JUST PULL SOMETHING
02:06:06:19  FROM SITE PACKAGES ON TO YOUR
02:06:10:01  MASK.
02:06:10:13  NOW IF IT'S UBUNTU TO UBUNTU,
02:06:15:16  THAT'S BETTER.
02:06:16:07  BUT IT'S TRICKY.
02:06:17:13  IT ALSO GETS TRICKY WHEN YOU
02:06:19:10  NEED TO RUN SCRIPTS THAT CREATE
02:06:21:10  FILES LIKE, SAY, MAKE
02:06:23:01  MIGRATIONS.
02:06:24:04  THAT KIND OF SITUATION CAN GET
02:06:27:04  REALLY HAIRY.
02:06:28:19  >> GREAT.
02:06:29:07  LET'S THANK LUKE AGAIN FOR THAT
02:06:30:22  LAST-MINUTE SAVE.
